3:T473,Most custom tailors under $2000 are going to be made overseas. Unless explicitly stated that they cut and sew the whole thing in-house, the bulk of their labour will be in another country. They will take your measurements here, send the order to Indonesia/Thailand/China, and have it flown back and forth for alterations. Nothing is done in-house. The bulk of the money you pay will be for shipping. This isn't necessarily bad per se, but it means waiting a long time between fittings and not being able to change your mind about certain details after the order is complete. Any alterations made after initial purchase will cost extra. If you just want a conservative suit that fits well the first and only time you wear it, this is the route to go. Go above $2000 and you start to see more in-house production, flexibility, and overall sense of care. These tailors will treat your suit less as a transaction and more as a journey, taking your opinions throughout into account and making changes as needed. Unlike the <$2000 tailors, minor alterations to the design can be made throughout the process (within reason) at no additional cost.4:T473,Most custom tailors under $2000 are going to be made overseas.
