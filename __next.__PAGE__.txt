Keep it for yourself or donate it to political parties and charities. Keep it and the media will have a field day lambasting you. Use it for yourself and you get lifestyle inflation, now you are reliant on this income to sustain your lifestyle. Your weakness for money is now ours to exploit, we know we can buy you over if need be. Those mortgages and monthly payments aren't gonna pay themselves :) Say you give it to the party to fund outreach and events for the citizens of Singapore. Now that you lost it or refuse to elect someone to take the role, you'll also be called out. "Why don't you just take the money? The citizens needs these programs to be funded! All your fault! All money is good money, don't let politics stop you from electing a LOTO and accepting the money!" Get the money OUT of politics. No lobbying by private companies and interests. The only way to win is to break the wheel, flip the table. If you sit down and play their game, you'll always lose. For they have established themselves as the incumbent and you, an opposition. Play by the rules made by them? A fool's errand.4:T4cc,The LOTO role was always a poisoned apple. Accept it and the salary, now you'll be under heavy scrutiny on how you spend it.
