10:T4ae,Years on in my mid thirties now and I'm in a much better place. I don't think I'm super passionate about what I do still but I'm peaceful about it. It still contributes a lot to society which is meaningful. I realized work-life balance is very important to me and I'm quite easily satisfied. I found out my core values are family, health and pleasure for self. Am in a job currently that allows me to knock off on the dot, have proper meal breaks, strictly office hours with no OT, and able to take leave flexibly. I got married and have two preschoolers now and I'm so glad I can spend quality time outside of work with them. I exercise regularly to ensure I'm healthy and won't have regrets when older. I invest my money in global diversified ETFs early on and the capital gains I get is sufficient for me to coastfire in a few years time and be on track for full retirement before 58. Am also a Christian which gives me hope beyond my current life. So if you ask me if I found something I'm truly passionate about career wise I'd answer I don't think so but I don't think it's important. If you ask if I'm happy currently? I'm happy with my life, thankful for my loved ones and fully at peace :)11:T4ae,Years on in my mid thirties now and I'm in a much better place.
