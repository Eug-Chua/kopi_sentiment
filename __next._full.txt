10:T430,I remember back in 1988, when I joined a stat board, there was a typist pool. The dept where I worked had 3 desk top computers set up on separate work desks for 12 officers to share. Most of the officers use the typist pool to prepare simple letters or faxes, because they were used to the typist pool and not familiar with word processing on computers. No email back then. So the 3 computers sat in the lonely corner and were seldom used  This was in spite of having to wait at least 1 hour for a simple letter or fax to be typed by the typist pool.
Within another 3 years, all officers had their own desk top computers and the typist pool disappeared, and email started to appear. Officers no longer had to waste time waiting for a letter or fax to be typed. Productivity increased through the roof.
My point is AI is a more powerful, more comprehensive tool than the humble desktop computer. It not only increases productivity, it can value-add and create.  
I believe AI is not a bubble and is only going to become more important, just like computers back in the 80's.11:T430,I remember back in 1988, when I joined a stat board, there was a typist pool.
