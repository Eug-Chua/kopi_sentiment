10:T571,My dad is going through it something similar now but it's not overblown yet. My late grandmother whom passed earlier last June had her flat willed under my father's name. We got my brother-in-law's friend, whom was a property agent, to find buyers for this flat. Given the current economy, we weren't able to find high buyers so they were proposing to lower it. But my father's sisters weren't having it, insisting it should be higher, causing a squabble within the family now. The real reason behind this wasn't out of greed, it was suspected to happen out of spite that one of my aunt's son-in-law was also a property agent, and they have been eyeing to have this flat's sale under their charge. My dad, whom has engaged my brother-in-law's friend for this flat's rental sales for years now(he did it for my senile grandmother to ensure she has an income with a helper to take care of her), insists he wants to have this neutral agent unaffiliated with the family to do it, in order to avoid certain complications with the rest of his siblings(such as accusations of usurping a bigger share). This family has a history of squabbling over money-related issues. All my Dad wants is to retain his good relationship with his siblings for the rest of his time. It was stressing him out over this, because he can't have 2 flats under his name and only had 6-month grace period to have it sold off.11:T571,My dad is going through it something similar now but it's not overblown yet.
