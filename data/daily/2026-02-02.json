Why treat the people like beggars when this is the people's money in the first place. CPF reform. There should be a BRS calculated for each age group from 21. If they have more than what they should have for their age, they should be able to withdraw the money in the event of unemployment, and return with interests once they find a job and pass their probation period.

IMO property is likely a big chunk of a Singaporean's portfolio which means the latter will be sensitive to Singapore's future. Think long term. With 1.5m, OP will be in a very good place if the OP goes with a BTO. OP can invest the amount in global passives, say MSCI ACWI (USD), which has generated 7.11% SI (annualised; Dec 2000 - Dec 2025) and is implicitly a bet that the world will remain relevant (vs single country/ SG risk). Just punching the numbers into a fin calc: FV = 6+ m where i/r = 5% (haircut from 7-11%); t = 30 (years); payment = 0 OP can live like a king and will likely be able to negotiate any financial decision from a position of strength, ie (hopefully) buy whatever you want whenever you want.",
