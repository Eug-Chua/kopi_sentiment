The SGD's 11-year high against the USD has Singaporeans worried about job losses and reduced competitiveness, with concerns that expensive goods and services could drive investors away.

However, rent/mortgage is much cheaper than in Singapore. I used to live in an 89msq apartment in Lyon, eur1.1k rental, plus electricity et tout, we're about eur1.5k fixed cost. Here, 80+msq is about a 3 bedroom apartment, you'd be looking at about sgd3k onwards, possibly sgd5k if you want to live closer to town/less local. However, eating out is slightly cheaper in Singapore, so at least that you can maintain. Someone talked about schooling, we paid maybe eur500 for our crèche, but here you'd be looking at around sgd1.5k and up for a private sch. Mais si tu va un crèche français, oulala ça va coût très cher. Additionally, we had a lot of free stuffs to do, places to visit cheaply (just driving) while we lived in France. Yes, there are free stuffs to do, but I estimate about a year in, you'd get bored of the beaches and parks and playgrounds that you can access for free. So you have to budget for travels as part of your expenditure. The last thing is about your wife. If she's not working, it can get tough socially.

Also diversification of currency, don't feel comfortable being 100% or tilted too heavily on 1 single currency. Long term wise I think USDSGD will just keep depreciating with the occasional pullback and spike, so am waiting to see if there could be a pullback to reduce my USD holdings.

I guess its partly inertia to convert each month's salary to SGD directly over the years and buy US equities, FDs and bills. Also diversification of currency, don't feel comfortable being 100% or tilted too heavily on 1 single currency. Long term wise I think USDSGD will just keep depreciating with the occasional pullback and spike, so am waiting to see if there could be a pullback to reduce my USD holdings.

        "text": "Hmm, I assume on eur47k you would be cooking a lot, spending your time doing free activities, maybe dining out once or twice a week. However, rent/mortgage is much cheaper than in Singapore. I used to live in an 89msq apartment in Lyon, eur1.1k rental, plus electricity et tout, we're about eur1.5k fixed cost. Here, 80+msq is about a 3 bedroom apartment, you'd be looking at about sgd3k onwards, possibly sgd5k if you want to live closer to town/less local. However, eating out is slightly cheaper in Singapore, so at least that you can maintain. Someone talked about schooling, we paid maybe eur500 for our crèche, but here you'd be looking at around sgd1.5k and up for a private sch. Mais si tu va un crèche français, oulala ça va coût très cher. Additionally, we had a lot of free stuffs to do, places to visit cheaply (just driving) while we lived in France. Yes, there are free stuffs to do, but I estimate about a year in, you'd get bored of the beaches and parks and playgrounds that you can access for free. So you have to budget for travels as part of your expenditure. The last thing is about your wife. If she's not working, it can get tough socially. Scout out some French Singapore clubs before deciding on the posting. Else looking after 4 singe daily is going to be challenging.",
