In a sense, I'm lucky that my friends first put in the work so that I could learn from them and also emulate their behaviour, and they also point out when I'm not pulling my weight (in the past). All trial and error. But I totally agree with you on colleagues. They're work friends, but not friend friends.",

Back when fingerprint matching and DNA testing became prominent in forensics, there were so many cases that police around the world had the chance to go back and reinvestigate, only to find out that a non-insignificant amount of people who were sentenced to death were completely innocent, and they were exonerated posthumously by DNA evidence. Who’s to say there won’t be such similar breakthroughs in technology and forensic science in the future? At least if it’s a life sentence we can release the innocent party and they can have somewhat of a second chance at life. Can’t bring back the dead.",
