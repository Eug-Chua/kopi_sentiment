Citizens express profound concerns about national identity erosion, with many questioning whether Singapore remains truly Singaporean amid aggressive immigration policies. Career insecurity runs rampant as fresh graduates abandon industry traineeships and professionals worry about competing with foreign talent after NS obligations. The fertility crisis compounds these fears, with Singaporeans dreading a future where they become minorities in their own homeland.",

The historic low birth rate of 0.87 has triggered fury at government policies that prioritize foreign imports over local family formation, with housing costs making parenthood financially impossible for many.

Even everyday irritations like Grab scams and Long John Silver's closure reflect deeper frustrations with a system that seems stacked against ordinary citizens.",
