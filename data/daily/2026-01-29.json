When an article came out celebrating that the system had rolled out to all terminals since 1 week before, I had just flown back a day before and it wasn't running. Since then, I've legit only seen the system active half the time I pass through the airport no matter which terminal it is, and of the other half of the time I've had the privilege to use it, it's slower than scanning passport and contributes to congestion, especially at T1 departure which is slow to begin with. The most annoying is when I'm let through the first gate and then it tells me to wait for a secondary check from the one officer doing the same thing for the other 20 gates, which wasn't a thing with passports.",

When an article came out celebrating that the system had rolled out to all terminals since 1 week before, I had just flown back a day before and it wasn't running. Since then, I've legit only seen the system active half the time I pass through the airport no matter which terminal it is, and of the other half of the time I've had the privilege to use it, it's slower than scanning passport and contributes to congestion, especially at T1 departure which is slow to begin with. The most annoying is when I'm let through the first gate and then it tells me to wait for a secondary check from the one officer doing the same thing for the other 20 gates, which wasn't a thing with passports.",
