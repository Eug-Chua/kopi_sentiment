However, I have the alternative of taking other buses to go to Clementi MRT instead, which I normally do not choose as I am headed eastbound. So without the app telling me the next bus timing, I waited... and waited... and waited.. and 20 mins later, 3 bus 74s came at once. 😑 And I ended up being late for work. If I had known there was this delay, I would definitely have taken a different bus to Clementi from the start. Really hope the app will be working again tomorrow. 🙏🏻",
