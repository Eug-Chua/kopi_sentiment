Singaporeans fear that polytechnics using AI-generated content signals the beginning of the end for creative fields, as students question the value of studying design when AI can do the work. There's also concern about aging workforce issues, with bus drivers in their 70s raising questions about safety and competency testing. Career transition fears linger as professionals worry whether it's too late to pivot in an AI-transformed job market.",

However, I have the alternative of taking other buses to go to Clementi MRT instead, which I normally do not choose as I am headed eastbound. So without the app telling me the next bus timing, I waited... and waited... and waited.. and 20 mins later, 3 bus 74s came at once. 😑 And I ended up being late for work. If I had known there was this delay, I would definitely have taken a different bus to Clementi from the start. Really hope the app will be working again tomorrow. 🙏🏻",

So without the app telling me the next bus timing, I waited... and waited... and waited.. and 20 mins later, 3 bus 74s came at once. 😑 And I ended up being late for work.
