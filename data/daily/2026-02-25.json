Citizens worry about government transparency regarding the $100 billion pandemic reserves drawdown, questioning who benefits from these massive expenditures and how spending efficiency is measured. Property-related fears surface strongly, with many scared by soaring resale HDB prices and wondering if they should wait until 35 for housing eligibility. There's also growing unease about Singapore's demographic shift, with some fearing foreigners will comprise 50% of residents within the next decade.",

Singaporeans are furious about the PAP's pattern of forecasting low surpluses or deficits to justify new taxes, only to report massive actual surpluses that disappear into reserves without accountability. The $15 billion surplus has triggered widespread demands for transparency and better public spending. Housing costs, education penny-pinching, and workplace issues like MC entitlements fuel additional frustration, while cultural tensions around religious practices and racial dynamics add to the collective irritation.",
