The COVID-19 drawdown of $100 billion from reserves has left many questioning accountability and wondering where the money actually went. Housing decisions weigh heavily on minds, with people torn between waiting until 35 for HDB eligibility or taking the plunge into expensive resale properties now. There's also underlying anxiety about Singapore's demographic shift, with some fearing foreigners will comprise half the population within a decade.",
