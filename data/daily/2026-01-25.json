Job cuts at Citigroup and concerns about tutoring income instability reflect broader employment anxieties, while working professionals express growing worry about burnout in an unsustainable work culture. Environmental concerns emerge from the haze situation, with Singaporeans fearing potential health impacts from cross-border pollution. Deeper systemic fears surface around food culture homogenization and human trafficking incidents, suggesting unease about losing Singapore's unique identity and security.",

Singaporeans are deeply frustrated with HDB resale negotiations and the stark contrast between today's soulless developments and the more characterful flats of the 1970s, despite their basic amenities. Work-life balance issues trigger intense anger, with people already taking medical leave just one month into 2026. Political frustrations run high over government salaries, foreign influence operations, and perceived inaction on various social issues, creating a sense that ordinary citizens' concerns are being overlooked.",

Musical moments and cultural connections provide emotional outlets, with people sharing appreciation for live performances and artistic experiences. The FIRE movement generates strong aspirational energy, though tempered by realistic concerns about social relationships and the challenges of early retirement planning in Singapore's expensive environment.",

That other employee is technically a senior, but she doesn’t really do much at work and passes all her projects to juniors. When things got messy, she blamed my colleague, and the management decided to fire him without properly assessing the situation.
