Fresh graduates express deep concerns about salary expectations and market conditions, with many questioning whether it's wise to pivot careers during current economic uncertainty. Social tensions add another layer of worry, with Singaporeans fearful of public confrontations on MRT and escalating youth violence in schools. The underlying thread is a society under stress, where phone addiction among teens is seen as an escape mechanism that turns dangerous when disrupted.",

Youth misconduct dominates the frustration narrative, from phone-wielding teens attacking school staff to PMD riders dragging police officers, with many blaming poor parenting and lack of discipline.

Economic pressures surface in complaints about inflated CNY prices and stagnant graduate salaries, while even fast food quality decline at Burger King becomes a flashpoint for broader dissatisfaction with declining standards.",
