Workers express dread about daily work routines and mounting financial pressures, with many questioning whether their salaries can keep pace with housing costs. The fear is particularly acute among those earning modest incomes who wonder if they can afford basic necessities like HDB flats. Concerns about industry disruption and career sustainability add another layer of uncertainty to an already stressed workforce.",

Live below your means, even if income is higher, say increase by $500, you may increase spending by $100-200 etc. Don't get into poor scenario like being a guarantor, take a big loan for luxury. BTO is easy TBH, you will get grant etc which will help you downpay, and your income may cover most installment as long as you keep working. Just get a BTO, it seems like 100-200k paper profit now, but it will definitely grow more by the time you MOP.",
