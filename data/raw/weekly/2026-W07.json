While walking through the car park near the Chinese temple at Maxwell MRT, I witnessed a traffic accident at around 11:40 a.m. today. It was the first time in my life that I saw a traffic accident happen right in front of me.\n\n&gt;I was the first person walking behind the mother and her daughter. A woman was driving out from the car park. She did not look to the right for pedestrians; she only looked to the left when she turned right. The front wheel of her car ran over the little girl’s abdomen first, then over the mother’s leg. After that, the woman pressed the accelerator hard, and the rear wheel ran over the mother’s abdomen again.\n\n&gt;I don’t know why she accelerated so quickly when she just exited the car park. I guess they might be tourists. I can help as a witness and testify about this traffic accident.\n\n&gt;I clearly saw that when the front wheel ran over them, the driver should have felt that there was something under the wheel. However, she did not stop to get out of the car to check. Instead, she accelerated strongly and continued to drive forward, which caused the rear wheel to run over the mother’s abdomen again.\n\n&gt;I panicked at that moment and cannot remember clearly whether the rear wheel ran over the little girl again. I was in shock when the incident happened right in front of me.\n\n&gt;At the time of the accident, the husband was not with them. Only the mother and daughter were there, and I was walking behind them. About two minutes later, the husband ran over and hugged the little girl.\n\n&gt;When the front wheel ran over the little girl, she was thrown and rolled about three times and ended up lying face down on the ground. Her mouth was in a pool of blood, next to her water bottle and her camera. The blood was flowing heavily from her mouth and spread thickly on the road.\n\n&gt;When the woman got out of the car and went to the back to check, she then realized that she had caused the accident.

Unless something is done to address it, people will continue to think that cars are better (because they are).\n\nThen, people will get angry as public transport quality declines.\n\nAs of now, the main reason stopping people from far flung areas switching to cars is the high cost, not because it is not logical (it is in fact very logical for you to want to switch, if you can afford it).\n\nThat and people living further out tend to be less wealthy.\n\nIn other countries and cities, jams and heavy traffic forces the car option to be equally shit, so there is no “alternative”, whether you can pay your way out or not.\n\nHere, people are priced out by design. Urban planning and car policies forces non-wealthy citizens into public transport and remove alternatives.\n\nThe barrier is not because people like public transport! It is because although someone can take 1/3 the time of their usual (peak) commute to travel by say taxi, it is financially unfeasible because it costs almost $100 a day to do so for some areas.\n\nThe layout of our country forces poor people to the far out area, concentrating the relatively wealthy people around the central core.\n\nThis made it seems like we are controlling car usage by forcefully locking in people who are more likely to switch away from public transport by pricing them out out private transport.\n\nThen, the wealthy people who do drive have less incentives to switch from cars, because they are not going to switch to the public transport option anyway even if it is competitive. Their trade off was never really about commute time, so how can you incentivise them out of cars even if you built a MRT station in their front porch?\n\nThen, the non-wealthy people who still overcame high cost to buy cars will try to maximise their value, so they will keep using and get pissed if the value of using cars is infringed.\n\nPrice them out, they get angry because the alternative really sucks and you are forcing them out without giving them a fair alternative. To cater to them, the alternatives need to be good (as direct and point-to-point, which runs counter to LTA’s hub-and-spoke approach).\n\nIn the end, trying to incentivise “car-lite” is doomed. For car-lite policies to work, people need to have cars vs public transport as their core question. But this seems to be not the case!\n\nAs I said, people who uses public transport are forced to. A large segment who do not does so by choice and could afford it. A smaller segment can be coaxed out but the way to do it contradict current policy directions.\n\nSo where is the large segment that policies can work on and incentivise change? If they do not exist, then how can existing policies work?\n\nUnless LTA abandon efficiency-maximisation and allow more point-to-point (direct) options in public transport, car will be king and users will still fight tooth and nail against public transport.\n\nExpress trains and buses are probably some of the things that are needed to coax the car users who could be coaxed.\n\nI am sure users are willing to pay more to a degree for more direct public transport options. And by direct I do not mean the current express bus system. Those sucks because of lengthy non-express sectors and limited routes/timing, which means you are often just paying with money and time for a seat, if it is even an option for you.",

But public transport is not there yet. It is better than most countries but still not good enough. Due to the last mile and other transition factors.\n\nI wrote to LTA to suggest some options for a bus service. You see my work place is like 5 mins away (by car, about &lt;5km away and about &lt;3km from the interchange) but I need to take 3 buses to get to work (1 to interchange, then 1 from interchange to 2 bus-stops away, then the last bus is another 2 bus stops after that). I researched the route and discovered that there 5 buses from the interchange heading so close to the bus stop i need to alight at, but all turn off (1 bus stops before) reaching my destination. Note that 5 bus stops in total are all quite far apart as there are along the PIE. \n\nI asked LTA to consider having a direct bus to my work location bus stop from the interchange as based on observations, hundreds take the same route as myself every morning. I see the same faces at the interchange. LTA said no.\n\nI understand that the MRT can't cover every gap, but at least buses can. Then to my horror, I discovered I do have a direct bus from my home bus stop to my work location. But you know what? Before it reaches my work bus stop, it goes on express not stopping at my work bus stop. Wow, amazing, striking 4D would be easier. \n\nLooks like I will eventually need to drive to work which is such a waste as the distance is so near. Taking the bus is hectic (For a 60+ year old) as the last bus is always crowded and it often is late due to jams on the PIE. Going home is no ride in the park as well and it gets worst when it rains.

This was 18 years ago. \n\nFast forward to 2024, my poly friend's wedding, she and her husband are expats. Both are in good stages of their careers, not rich but well to do as career is in good place. They paid for our bridesmaid dresses, bride let us choose from Shein and she bought them for us, meet us for a dinner while she passed us the dress 👗 (she treated us the dinner, while we delegated the bridesmaid work, who takes care of what, who recce the place while joining the bride and groom for menu tasting, who is bridesmaid of honor and so on)\n\nDuring pre wedding decor we all woke up super early (as its a lunch), we did our own makeup and hair, help to decorate the wedding lunch space. Help each other (bridesmaids, there are about 6 of us) with hair and makeup. We bring our own decorations to contribute, like i bought a bubble gun and solution, fairy lights and flower petals, out of my own pocket.\n\nWe bridesmaids also give ang baos for the wedding lunch. It was at Andaz, I gave a $288 angbao, with $2 notes from the flower series (older singapore notes), cause my mum has some old notes. Some bridesmaids who are closer to bride, like a workplace bestie bought her a customised jewellery piece on top of ang bao.\n\nAfter the wedding lunch, we joined the bride and groom and his friends from the country he's from, for a dinner by the fullerton riverside, as a compensation from the bride and groom. Bride and groom gave us a small wedding gift bag, which the bride's sister prepared on their behalf, with a $50 ang bao. \n\nI'm sharing, because i feel everyone's life experiences are different. And at the end of the day, bridesmaid duty is quite heavy, choose wisely who you are a bridesmaid for. It is okay to reject being a bridesmaid if you think you dont not have the bandwidth. \n\nAnd depending on how close you are to the bride, like my good friend despite in the midst of divorce she still find the mental strength and bandwidth to be a bridesmaid. This is because she is very good friend with the bride, and the bride is not chinese, who is not pantang whether a \"divorcee\" will pass the luck to the newlyweds. Like they are such good friends, nothing stands in the way for them celebrate for the bride's union joys. \n\nOP, revisit why you become a bridesmaid moving forward.

Why should they incur extra costs for sth thats not theirs to begin with? And OP did try to help as much as she could alr.\n\nI believe this boils down to the bride not being thoughtful and sensitive enough to make OP feel appreciated, not necessarily because of money entirely. One time I had to fly overseas to be a bridesmaid, of course the ang bao the bride gave me was not enough to cover the tickets and everything, she paid for the dress and didnt refer to me as helpers LOL, so I felt very happy that I could be there for her big day.

Our deepest condolences to the family and hope justice will be served. \n\nMy question is , if we happened to witness an accident , and the victims are injured, how can we render help to them before the paramedics arrive? \nAre there things we can do to help with the situation instead of being bystanders ? \n\nCuz i saw the video of that accident and alot people were just standing around observing what was happening untill the paramedics arrived , so how can we help out in the situation by any way before the ambulance/paramedics arrive ??\n \n\n\nEdit ;\n\n\nConsolidation of points : \n\n1. Call 995 ( inform the exact location and number of victims , if they are stuck in a car etc).\n\n2. Dont move victim\n\n3. Use Umbrella to help shade Victims from Sun/Rain \n\n4. Call out for anyone who has first aid /BCLS training / find the nearest AED ( check locations on myresponder app ) \n\n5. Ensure the victim is conscious/has a heart beat if not administer CPR \n\n6.  Help to clear/redirect traffic if its not on a highway.. \n\n7. Help with crowd control/clearing the crowd\n\n8. If there's a GP clinic nearby , run and get a doctor to help. \n\n9.  Take note of what happened, time of accident etc so you can explain to the paramedics /SPF when they arrive..(for investigation purposes)\n- videos , pictures, type down in your phone.\n\n\n",

But became middle upper after.\n\n1. Don’t splurge. The temptations to literally throw ur money for ego and pride is a killer. Whatever you buy has no value except its logo. If you die die want one for looks. Then it’s an insecurity. Parents had this and splurged on unnecessary things.\n\n2. Children payments expenses. Tuition, welfare, maid, etc; understand the need for a helper/maid since parents might be busy. With tuition you can definitely find good ones within a budget means. And more importantly it’s the child’s brain development. Understanding how children learn and associate knowledge to memory and primary motor function would literally have more worth than just throwing things ur child’s way.\n\n3. House mortgage/ car mortgage. Parents once again switch cars when and how they want. From Benz to BMW. And back. General rule of thumb is can you afford it 10x if you can then go for it buddy.\n\n4. Money decisions. What my parents didn’t consider was growth factor and change in business climate. So they don’t have backend extra cash to tide over rough seasons. Or to evolve the business to e-commerce (2015 period) \n\n5. Cash could have went to passive income. There’s good debt and bad debt. Good debt helps you earn more money to pay it off. Parents could have laid a portion of cash, while getting a landed or condo to rent it out for extra passive income.\n\n6. Family relations. Family relations sour from the knowledge of money. My father is quite mommas boy. He side with my grandma more than my mom and because of that relationship sour. Relatives knew he operate the business with my mom. And how much they were earning and always gave “opinions” and wanted a slice of the pie. Until it all went crashing down. Please draw boundaries.\n\n7. Over commitment to secondary relatives. This is parents and siblings. Once you have kids and a wife. Your commitment and primary family is them. You start from scratch with morals and principles you want to put into this family. Over commitment to your siblings and parents. Will blind you and put you in a bind financially, slowly affecting your primary family. And making your life difficult.\n\n7b.) your siblings and parents are able to raise themselves unless they’re disabled or ill. If they’re having difficulties or are in a tight patch. Temporary help is fine. However long term commitment when they’re grown adults responsible, it’s just you unable to say no. Parents will have to retire and you will have to give an allowance and help raise them. However you have siblings who do that too. So make sure it’s equal. Or you all come to an agreement. \n\nThis is all my take upvote or downvote. This is my experience growing up in a well to do family who came crashing down into middle SES. I don’t say this to criticise and hate my parents just a very non personal understanding and analysis of behaviors I wouldn’t bring into my family when I start it.

Just bear in mind that you'd have to pay an additional +$15k on top of your flat cost  (i call it the singles tax). You can consider taking HDB's optional component scheme (opting in flooring, wash basin/shower fittings) which is another add on $3.3K - $3.5K (?) if you want some cost savings (&amp; are not picky). All payable through cpf.\n\nI think it puts things into perspective once you get your flat. I was like you too, yolo-ing etc. But after the booking, my mindset changed and i looked at my finances and started saving. \n\nMy only regret was not trying sooner for a flat, everything else is secondary.

Even if it’s a 200k flat and you need to loan 150k, mortgage payment for a 20 year loan (say your key collection is when you’re 45) is ~$800. For a 4k salary hob with CPF, about that much should be going to OA each month. \n\nAlso, you shouldn’t need to loan that much because you will be accumulating CPF OA in the years when the flat is being built.\n\nThe most important thing is you need to stay employed!

On the other side of the grandmother, there was also a boy who I assume is her brother (maybe around 10-12 years old). All of a sudden, this extremely angry woman (who I assume is their mother) stormed towards them while screaming at the top of her lungs, and when she got close to the girl, she started hitting the girl very hard while continuously yelling at the girl and the grandmother. She slapped the girl's face very hard twice and also hit her on the back while berating her in front of everyone.

I'm still thinking about it a few days later, and I'm now wondering if I should have said or done something to intervene at the moment. Again, there was a language barrier here, so l have no idea what she was so upset about, but nothing, absolutely nothing can justify slapping a child across the face so hard and hitting a child in anger like that.

While walking through the car park near the Chinese temple at Maxwell MRT, I witnessed a traffic accident at around 11:40 a.m. today. It was the first time in my life that I saw a traffic accident happen right in front of me.\n\nI was the first person walking behind the mother and her daughter. A woman was driving out from the car park. She did not look to the right for pedestrians; she only looked to the left when she turned right. The front wheel of her car ran over the little girl’s abdomen first, then over the mother’s leg. After that, the woman pressed the accelerator hard, and the rear wheel ran over the mother’s abdomen again.\n\nI don’t know why she accelerated so quickly when she just exited the car park. I guess they might be tourists. I can help as a witness and testify about this traffic accident.\n\nI clearly saw that when the front wheel ran over them, the driver should have felt that there was something under the wheel. However, she did not stop to get out of the car to check. Instead, she accelerated strongly and continued to drive forward, which caused the rear wheel to run over the mother’s abdomen again.\n\nI panicked at that moment and cannot remember clearly whether the rear wheel ran over the little girl again. I was in shock when the incident happened right in front of me.\n\nAt the time of the accident, the husband was not with them. Only the mother and daughter were there, and I was walking behind them. About two minutes later, the husband ran over and hugged the little girl.\n\nWhen the front wheel ran over the little girl, she was thrown and rolled about three times and ended up lying face down on the ground. Her mouth was in a pool of blood, next to her water bottle and her camera. The blood was flowing heavily from her mouth and spread thickly on the road.\n\nWhen the woman got out of the car and went to the back to check, she then realized that she had caused the accident. She raised her voice at the father while their daughter was injured and kept trying to explain that she was not at fault.",

The driver still fking go tug on the kids hand??? Tf????? \n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/share/v/1K1Gmp2Rrj/\n---\n\n“This morning I walked to the market to buy coriander to make bánh mì. Because I forgot to order coriander, I went to the market and then witnessed a traffic accident this morning in the car park of the Chinese temple near Maxwell MRT. This was the first time in my life that I witnessed a traffic accident happen right in front of me, at around 11:40 a.m. today.\n\nI was the first person walking behind a mother and her child. A woman was driving out from the car park and did not look to her right for pedestrians; she only looked to her left while turning right. Then the front wheel of her car ran over the little girl’s stomach, after that it ran over the mother’s leg, and then the woman suddenly stepped hard on the accelerator, causing the rear wheel to run over the mother’s stomach. I don’t know why she accelerated so quickly right after exiting the car park. I guess they’re tourists. I can help and might be the one to testify in the traffic accident.\n\nI saw very clearly that when the accident happened, the front wheel had already run over a person and the driver should have felt that there was something under the car, but she did not stop to get out and check. Instead, she accelerated strongly and continued driving, which caused the rear wheel to run over the mother’s stomach one more time. I panicked and cannot remember clearly whether the rear wheel ran over the little girl again — I really can’t remember because I was in shock from what happened in front of me.\n\nAt the time of the accident, the woman’s husband was not with her — only the mother and child were there, and I was walking behind them. About two minutes later, the husband ran over and held the little girl in his arms. When the front wheel ran over the little girl, she rolled three times and ended up lying face down on the ground, with her mouth bleeding heavily. The father used a water bottle and a camera to block the blood, but the blood from the child’s mouth flowed a lot and spread all over the road.\n\nWhen the woman got out of the car from the back to look, she then realized that she had caused the accident. She shouted loudly at the father who was holding his daughter, and she tried to explain that she was not at fault.”\n",

After I got my order, i deliberately walked to her.  \nBefore I can opened my mouth she shouted at me saying, \"U are of a low quality character to scold me like that\".   \nI replied in Mandarin, \"I have to do so with people of low quality like u\".   \nAnd i walked away. For that 20 secs or so while i walked away, she shouted at me scolding me.   \nHer voice literally pierced through the whole ground floor of the building.   \nI sashayed my ass slowly and quietly soaking in all the attention while making my exit.   \nStood up yes, let her screamed at me like a crazy uncivilised bitch. That was the icing for me. \n\n![gif](giphy|hVYVYZZBgF50k)",

      "selftext": "Hi, long time lurker first time poster, using a burner account. I’m in my mid 30s and after working for a little over a decade, I’ve managed to accumulate about SGD 2 mil in liquid assets (not including my house and CPF). The screenshot provides some proof (my equity account). I don’t have generational wealth, but I’m very financially secure. \n\nThis financial security has made my life much, much better. These are my 3 favourite things about getting rich. \n\n1. **I can prioritise life over work.** \n\nMy kids had a bout of illness recently and I took time off work to care for them. As I went through my calendar for the month, I realised that on average, I had worked four days or less each week. And more importantly, I was never stressed about what this might mean for my work or my performance.\n\nThis mindset and ability to let go are new to me. I’ve always put my best into school and work, and this paid off. I scored well, got a high paying job, and promoted fast. But as my salary grew so did my stress, my belly, and the number of friendships I lost. So over the past two years I’ve consciously traded work to reverse these trends and spend more time with my family.\n\nWork-life balance looks different for everyone. I like but I don’t love my work, so having the peace of mind from my finances to no longer feel a strong need to work has absolutely done wonders for me. My family, health, and social life have taken priority over my work, and I feel a lot happier most days. \n\n2. **I have a portfolio that lets me sleep well at night**\n\nSince this is r/singaporefi I guess I should share my current portfolio. It’s roughly: 65% equities (LSE ETFs), 30%  cash and bonds, and 5% gold. \n\nCan I optimize my portfolio? Definitely. Given my age I should allocate more to riskier assets, maybe even crypto. In fact, I got rich not just through high savings from a high paying job, but also because my old portfolio was almost 100% equities with many stock picks (big tech) that did very well. \n\nBut my old portfolio was too risky and I often lost sleep over it. No longer. After crossing the SGD 1.5 mil mark I rebalanced it slowly to where it is now and I have never lost any sleep over my portfolio since then. Yet the returns on my suboptimised portfolio last year covered my \n\nentire annual expense. \n\nAnd that’s one of the best things about being rich. I don’t need to take financial risks. I don’t need to chase high returns. I don’t need to care about vagaries of the market. I can just do whatever preserves my wealth and lets me sleep best at night.\n\n3. **I spend whatever I want on people and things that make my life better.**\n\nMy family and I went to MBS last year. When we arrived we realised that we had forgotten one of our kids’ shoes. Driving home or letting kiddo walk around barefooted weren’t options. So we just waltzed into one of the atas MBS kids shop and picked up a ridic overpriced pair of kids shoes. In our calculus, it was more than worth it to spend three digits to save the effort of carrying our chonky kid around the whole day. \n\nI can’t afford to buy a GCB or a sports car or fancy watches. But I can take grab everywhere, order ala carte at restaurants, and fly premium economy. I can splurge on experiences like holidays and musicals with my parents and wife and kids. I can throw money at problems and buy time and convenience. And to me, these things are the best uses of money, and one of the greatest perks of being rich. \n\n——\n\nTL;DR Life gets much better as you get rich, but only if you let it.\n\nGood luck everyone!

But once you defeat that temptation, that “in-game monster” is gonna drop $7 for you to collect.\n\n  \n\nOnly managing your finances at the end of the month when bills are due is gonna be hard if you don’t have stop gaps every 30 days of the month.\n\n  \n\nSo go forth and defeat your daily temptations: reserve 1 day a week to treat yourself to a casual meal. Negotiate downwards how many drinks you’re gonna have at a social event. \n\n  \n\nFinances is as much internal as it is tangible.\n\n  \n\nFrom somebody who lives paycheck to paycheck, I managed this month with money leftover on payday so I see this game as a success even though I’m only level 3.\n\n  \n\nAnother pro tip: those with high credit card balances - and find yourself with little to no cash after payday. Convert your balance to installments and stop using CC. Use cash and you can eat $5 cai png instead of having to charge food to your credit to survive. It’s cheaper in the long run and prevents snowball. ",

Second, inflation rate is not actually equal for everyone.\n\nFor the first point, you might need to relook at whether 1.3m in 2036 (11 years from now) is actually enough. For the second point, you will need to see what you are actually spending on.\n\nIf you envision owning a car, multiple properties and frequent visits to hospital, those are things that are inflating at a very high rate in Singapore. So, inflation rate will be high.\n\nIf you envision taking public transport, eating more hawker and having a relatively healthy life, inflation is not as high.\n\nAnother thing people ignore is CPF. CPF is a bond-like instrument. Whether you like it or not, 37% of your income goes there so remember to factor it in.\n\nAssuming you have hit FRS, all excess above FRS can be taken out from 55 onwards.\n\nThis means from 55 onwards, the interest from OA of 2.5% is perpetually available for you to take out and amount never goes down as long as you only take out the interest.\n\nFrom 65 onwards, CPF pays out around 6% of your RA annually. This means it is like a 6% perpetual bond (note it does eat into the RA amount but otherwise, it functions just like a perpetual bond).\n\nSo in reality, you don't actually need as much to retire, provided you are ok to see your cash-funded assets go down before 55 before being supplemented later by cashflow from CPF.\n\nIt does make calculations much more complicated but those are things that are usually ignored for a simpler 4%SWR.\n\nAlso, the 4% SWR is already inflation-adjusted. Some people miss this point and even the researcher who came up with it says that people can actually draw up to 4+% (can't remember exact % but I guess you already know this) because again, another point people ignore is that in retirement, you usually spend less. No more travels, no more funding of kids' education, no more mortgages, etc.\n\nThat said, the SWR is meant for a 30-year retirement based on the research. So nobody knows how it performs for longer period but in theory, you can just reduce the SWR for higher success or start with more.\n\nIn any case, it is always good to err on side of caution but do also note that there are many people who retire on less than this amount TODAY in Singapore, granted the lifestyle will not be a glamorous 1.\n\nI suggest you first calculate the present value of 1.3m in 2036 then see if it meets what you feel would be enough today.",

We saw major names in the software sector getting hit with sharp corrections on fears that AI and Claude, specifically, could disrupt their subscription based business model. \n\nThen earlier this week, we saw reports of friction between OpenAI and Nvidia, sparking a correction for the semiconductor sector. This week, after major tech giants reported an unprecedented, hyper-aggressive rise in capex spending, the entire tech sector just sold down. \n\nValuations are the single most crucial thing in investinng. Buying a super high quality business at a gargantuan valuation makes it a bad decision automatically. And by now, I'm sure that everyone would be familiar with the fact that what goes up, must come down. \n\nTo address the common wisdom that it's impossible to time a crash, and hence continously buying into US tech despite skyhigh valuations is justified, let me pose a simple question to you. Are you sure that the risk to reward ratio is in your favour? How probable is it that when the market continues to go up and tanks eventually, it will still be higher than the current price that you are buying it? \n\nMe personally, seeing this volatility, well, I'll be lying if I said it didn't feel soooo good to prove the haters wrong. But am I going to liquidate my position in my dividend stocks in HK and go all in on us tech? No. I'm going to continue to remain rationale. Should the valuations of the companies continue to go down, I may even start a SMALL TINY position in solid, blue chip US tech companies. But as of right now, I'll still be patiently waiting on the sidelines. \n\nTo those that saw huge drawdowns in your portfolio this week, please take a moment to pen down your thoughts and emotions. It really helps to guard against FOMO and hype chasing, a few months later down the road. Valuable lessons can be learnt from this drawdown.\n\nTo end with a quote, \"The stock market functions as a mechanism that transfers wealth from the impatient to the patient\". ~ Warren Buffett. \n",

Therefore here I am trying to rearrange my life after my soul mate of 25yrs suddenly departs from my life. \n\n*BTO:* \n\n* Have contacted HDB and they have exercise leniency in my case and allow me to keep the BTO. Application has also been changed to reflect my name only. \n* HPS does not work in this case because keys are yet to be collected. \n\n*Why take a loan for the BTO when I can fully paid it off?* \n\n* Original intention was to paid it off once we collect the keys so we don't have to worry about the other party financing the flat alone if one dies. \n* But situation changes now, his OA used +AI will now become cash proceeds when I sell instead of returning to his CPF-OA if he is still alive. I would rather keep the cash proceeds now and generate income from it while paying it slowly. If i happen to die with a loan, my beneficiary can just sell it off. \n\n*6K per month expenses &amp; travel expenses seems high*\n\n* I included cost of owning a car in the future (counting it as 2.5K in the expense for monthly repayments + vehicle expenses) into the predicted expenses. \n* Current expenses is less than 4K (including regularly investments and insurance), not counting one-time off stock purchases.  \n* Travel expenses and trips can always be adjusted, it just a wish to continue to what I used to do.\n\n*Liquid net* *worth, insurance payout, inheritance?*\n\n* No inheritance. Only a fully paid HDB, a fully paid car, CPF &amp; a business. \n* No insurance payout except DPS. He is not insurable, main reason why he wants me saves majority of my income for the future if he is gone. \n* Did not include valuables like gold, watches as I did not intend to sell unless I need the money for survival. (Est\\~300-350k after a haircut of 30% loss if I were to sell it)\n\n*Income:*\n\n* FT job \\~ 100K \n* Side hustle was approx \\~ 60-70K last year. But I project it be to 30K this year as I would just doing the minimum to keep myself relevant in the field.\n* Business \\~ it was my late husband business. Running a business that I am no prior experience in a lot of work and stress. But I would like to keep it going for as long as I can, no intention to just close or sell it even before I try, it was his effort and something he is passionate about but will let go once it becomes not profitable/sustainable. Income is just based of the salary I am current drawing, which is way below what he used to draw. Had to hire more help which thus increase in operating cost.  \n\n*Isn't there a income cap for bto buyers? How u get it in the first place?*\n\n* We applied it during covid years. I got no income from side hustle only FT job. His business was badly hit by covid for more than 2years. He did not draw any salary and sales drop 90%.  ",

While I understand there will be more financial pressure in life and many family do this because of survival rather than choice due to the economy circumstances, but if both of you think yes we can endure and survive this for couple of years then I would say do it.\n\nThe fact that your child has shown some challenges, I believe that being a parent means being the primary care giver rather than outsource it if you can afford the financial impact because this is a moment that cant be repeated. Obviously you also don't want your kid refuse you and prefer being held by the nanny. Remember, child never asked to be born, we parents are the ones who bring them into this world.\n\nAgain, many people don't have this option and no choice because there is a real economy pressure. But knowing that you are considering this I assume you might have some rooms there. Discuss this with you partner and hopefully you both reach the best decision",

For context, I set 120 USD to VOO, 50 USD to QQQM, and 75 USD to VXUS for this biweekly recurring buy.\n\nTLDR:\n\n(i) Want to confirm if this method is “proper DCA”?\n\n(ii) Is the amount/ratio invested into the 3 ETFs logical?\n\n(iii) Are there any other things I can play around with?",

Their exchange rates are also very good.\n\nThe ireland-domiciled equivalents of what you want to do is VUAA / CSPX + QQQM (this is fine with US-listed) + EXUS.

I just started riding a motorcycle, and as I approach 40 with increased health risk, I’m considering my insurance strategy to ensure my spouse isn't burdened if I'm sidelined by a road accident or health issue.\n\nProfile:\n\n* Demographics: 38M, Married, Working Spouse, No kids planned.\n* Goal: Self Barista FIRE by age 45+ (Target: S$1.4M in non-CPF &amp; housing assets).\n* Income: $120k (Day job) + $24k (Side hustle) = $144k p.a.\n* Current Assets: ETF: $406k | CPF: ~$180k across OA/SA/MA/Endowus | SSB: $15k\n* Liabilities: HDB Loan (~$143k remaining, split 50/50 with wife; $727/month total).\n* Investment S$5k/month into Global ETFs + S$1.3k/month  from OA in EndowUS Amundi Index MSCI Word Fund\n* Personal Expenses: S$40k per annum\n\nCurrent Insurance Stack:\n\n* Hospitalization: Income Enhanced Shield (B1 Public) + Deluxe Care Rider (5% co-pay cap $3k).\n* Life/CI: GE Supreme Living (Term $300k, till 65) + Singlife MINDEF ($100k Term).\n* Personal Accident: Singlife MINDEF ($100k) + AIA Corporate ($250k).\n* Disability: GE PayAssure ($1,200/month payout till 65).\n* CareShield Life ($600/month).\n* Corporate Term/TPD ($100k).\n\n\nThe Dilemma: \n\n1. **Increased Risk Profile** I recently started commuting by motorcycle. As I age, I am increasingly concerned that a road accident or health issue could lead to a disability that prevents me from working. My biggest fear is becoming a financial burden on my spouse.\n\n2. **Protecting the FIRE Timeline** I currently invest $4k–$5k/month to hit Barista FIRE by 45. If I lose my ability to earn, I don't just lose my lifestyle; I lose the ability to compound my investments. I want to \"insure\" my investment contributions so that my retirement goal remains on track even if I can't work.\n\nSpecific Questions for the Community\nHow much to insure? My current DII payout is only $1,200/month. Should I insure for my full income (~$10k/month), or just enough to cover expenses + my monthly investment target?\n\nHow long should the coverage last? Since my goal is Barista FIRE at 45, does it make sense to get a policy that covers me until:\n\nAge 45: The moment I \"retire,\" and cancel my plan\n\nAge 55: When I can withdraw CPF OA/SA\n\nAge 65: When CPF LIFE payouts begin",

If you worry about the increased risk events (I.e. riding bike), you can increase the personal accident sum assured. I think your dilemma more into what's enough for your wife especially facing long term disability.\n\nPersonally, here's my thought process:\nTerm life/TPD insurance sum assured: I covered till 65 only and I don’t have dependent when my kid grow up. Sum assured is based on 15 years of expenses. Post that will be covered by the investment portfolio if live longer.\n\nCritical illness: I covered only 6 years of expenses as I do some research and majority late stage illness can live only 3-5 years. If unfortunate to encounter early CI I checked with insurance agent the cost is about 100k, then i just have to pay from the emergency cash/investments portfolio as the cost of ECI and benefit is not justified. \n\nYou can consider the short term disability income insurance covered till 45 or 50 whichever you deem is the critical period in the event doc certify you are unable to work for regardless of illness/accident.\n\nThe long term care insurance is underrated though we have careshield life. Given that both you and wife dont intend to have kid, you might need to think who going to take care of you if face long term care? Hence, I buy the enhanced careshield life fully pay by CPF.\n\nMy thought about insurance is I wouldn't know how much is enough, but I will buy some to cushion the impact and the rest to be covered by investment portfolio.\n\nIf you care so much about the loved one, remember to do the Last Power of Attorney (it's free till March this year), do the nomination for CPF and insurance, and lastly the will. This will minimise the hurdle to be faced by your loved one.",
