      "selftext": "TLDR: Very poor management by the parties involved, Scoot and the Airport, from scheduled takeoff to actual arrival took 12hours+\nsome ppl (including elderlies and ppl on crutches) only received food 9 hours later and went without sleep throughout the entire ordeal, did not receive on ground transport and hotel contrary to Scoot's statement. \n\n\nI was unfortunately on flight TR 497 from KL to SG which Scoot said: \"affected customers were provided with accommodation, refreshments and on-ground transport.\" Over here https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/scoot-flight-from-kuala-lumpur-on-feb-9-cancelled-after-technical-fault-detected\n\n\nSurprised to read about the Refreshment and passengers being sent to hotel to rest, as quite a few of us had a totally different experience, went about 9 hours without food or rest.\n\nTill today, we have not heard directly from Scoot (although we booked through trip.com who reached out to us so wondering if Scoot only communicated with passengers who booked directly).\n\nWhile I can understand the technical issues was unexpected, Scoot's handling of the cancellation was extremely disappointing, there was lack of communication, clarity and proper process. \n\nWe only managed to get our boarding pass about 9 hours later, after much detours and abrupt changes, without sleep or food (even though Scoot mentioned providing Refreshments, it seemed like most passengers did not received it). Only arrived back in Singapore at around 12pm the following day, which meant the need to apply for leave from work.\n\nNevertheless, it was an interesting experience, we quickly became friends with strangers, including an elderly Korean lady who was travelling alone and anxious. When we finally boarded the next flight back 12 hours later, we saw many fellow passengers  who bonded and helped each other through the arduous 12 hours, taking pictures and biding farewell even though they did not speak the same language.\n\n\n-Sat on the runway for about an hour before the crew finally informed us of the issue\n\n-Only offered plain water at 12am. When we requested for snacks, after a 2 hours delay into a supposedly 1 hour flight, the crew informed us we had to purchase in flight meals\n\n-There was another airplane stuck behind us for about 3 hours since our flight was blocking access to the takeoff runway, it was eventually towed away\n\n-Could feel the Captain was empathetic which is appreciated, however, there were multiple occasions when they didnt update us for up to an hour even though they announced they would in 20 mins etc\n\n-Once we arrived back at the terminal, the nightmare continued, total chaos and lack of clarity + communication \n\n-There was a long queue to enter the only lift which would bring us inside  the airport, once we exited the lift we were told to head to counter P9\n\n-After queuing for a long time to enter P9, the other passengers in front of us suddenly turned around and walked towards the opposite direction, the staff did not communicate anything, we only found out through word of mouth from other passengers that P9 was for passengers who would like to cancel and get a refund.\n\n-It seemed like Refreshments were being distributed at P9 so we ended up with zero Refreshment as we had to follow the queue of ppl walking in the opposite direction if we're would like to take the next earliest flight by SIA.\n\n-Again, through word of mouth, at around 2 or 3 am, we were told that we would be heading to sunway pyramid hotel which was about an hour away, this created a lot of unrest among the weary passengers (many haven't eaten or rest since 10pm). It didnt make sense to travel to the hotel, spend proably an hour or two, or maybe even lesser accounting for potential traffic jam,  waiting time to check in hundreds of passengers,before travelling another hour back to the airport as we heard the earliest flight was around 9/10am (checked with the staff if we could opt for a later flight to get some rest if we were to go to the hotel but they seemed as lost as we were). At this point there was a queue of a few hundred passengers waiting to exit the immigration which would take some time too\n\n-When we finally exited immigration, a lot of us lost sight of the staff and did not know where to board the bus to the hotel, some passengers who did not speak English were very anxious\n\n-We ended up making friends with other passengers to share info and figure things out, \"adopting\" an elderly Korean who was travelling alone and spoke no English as she looked anxious\n\n-since we lost sight of the staff, about a hundred of us gathered at Scoot's terminal, which was unfortunately not opened yet\n\n-after some time a staff finally came to Scott's counter and told us to follow her to board the bus to the hotel\n\n-while waiting (what seems like an hour) for the bus,  at about 5am the staff told us we will not be travelling to the hotel anymore,  but head to the next terminal to board the 10am flight to Singapore\n\n-the airport shuttle bus which is used by the public to the terminal was full which led to even more waiting\n\n-once we boarded the bus, we were surprised to see the staff not onboard,  we were expected to make our own way, some passengers alighted at the wrong stop and we had to help inform them\n\n-finally reached SIA terminal at about 6am and got our boarding pass, close to 9 hours since the scheduled takeoff and about 6 hours since we disembarked from the plane\n\n-the staff at the counter seemed unaware about the flight cancellation and was surprised to hear our flight was supposed to take off 10 hours ago\n\n-we were finally issued 35RM meal voucher, proceed to have our first meal in 10 hours with our newfound friends and the elderly Korean passenger\n\n-quite a few of us had difficulty entering the departure hall as the Malaysian immigration doesn't seem to be aware of the flight cancellation, some ended up spending more than an hour after being sent on a wild goose chase by the immigration officers who did not knew how to handle passengers from the cancelled flight\n\nOverall a very tiring but interesting experience\n\n\nEdit\n1. We didnt really had time to get food as the staff told us to follow them, from the moment we dismebarked to the moment we were reissued a new boarding pass, it was endless waiting and queueing at immigration, bus stop etc as you can read from above. If u wandered off the get food you might get left behind. It would have been a different story if there was clear communication as to where to reschedule our flights as opposed to asking a few hundred ppl to follow them without much info.\n\n2. The point of this post is to highlight how the process was extremely disorganised and disappointing. Funny to see some snarky and strange comments focusing on 3rd party booking lol. From what we saw, Passengers who booked direct + 3rd party went through the same process and got the same treatment. They were so disorganised I doubt they even knew who booked direct and who booked through 3rd party.\n\n3. I am not sure how flight cancellation is typically handled, but yes it seems like it wasn't solely Scoot which mismanaged. We suspect tue staff who spoke to us were from KLIA, so we proably had zero contact with anyone from Scoot.\n\n4. While it was an incredibly fustrating and anxious experience, a minor few were condescending in their interaction with the staff, which was pretty ugly. At the end of the day, everyone is just trying their best, the staff looked as lost as we were, they dont make the SOPs and seemed to be poorly trained, which isnt their fault. They are just junior employees who probably have zero decision making powers, not right to act out on them.\n\n5.  Most ppl were kind and helpful; kindness cuts across language barriers and nationality, strangers turned into friends who looked out for one another since we had no one else to rely upon.",

Ground handling was chaotic with no clear communication, no directions, and no proper coordination. \n\nContrary to what was reported in the news article, none of us got any timely transport or hotel accommodation. We literally disembarked the plane at 2 15 am leh. So we were basically left stranded and awake the whole night with no idea what to do until we checked in for our replacement SQ flight at 6 am. The post-disruption management was extremely poor and fell far short of expectations, especially for an airline under the SIA group.\n\nNonetheless, one heck of an experience lor especially considering we opted for a flight back instead of a bus/train to save time but end up the whole flight journey became 12 hrs+ 😂",

Unless something is done to address it, people will continue to think that cars are better (because they are).\n\nThen, people will get angry as public transport quality declines.\n\nAs of now, the main reason stopping people from far flung areas switching to cars is the high cost, not because it is not logical (it is in fact very logical for you to want to switch, if you can afford it).\n\nThat and people living further out tend to be less wealthy.\n\nIn other countries and cities, jams and heavy traffic forces the car option to be equally shit, so there is no “alternative”, whether you can pay your way out or not.\n\nHere, people are priced out by design. Urban planning and car policies forces non-wealthy citizens into public transport and remove alternatives.\n\nThe barrier is not because people like public transport! It is because although someone can take 1/3 the time of their usual (peak) commute to travel by say taxi, it is financially unfeasible because it costs almost $100 a day to do so for some areas.\n\nThe layout of our country forces poor people to the far out area, concentrating the relatively wealthy people around the central core.\n\nThis made it seems like we are controlling car usage by forcefully locking in people who are more likely to switch away from public transport by pricing them out out private transport.\n\nThen, the wealthy people who do drive have less incentives to switch from cars, because they are not going to switch to the public transport option anyway even if it is competitive. Their trade off was never really about commute time, so how can you incentivise them out of cars even if you built a MRT station in their front porch?\n\nThen, the non-wealthy people who still overcame high cost to buy cars will try to maximise their value, so they will keep using and get pissed if the value of using cars is infringed.\n\nPrice them out, they get angry because the alternative really sucks and you are forcing them out without giving them a fair alternative. To cater to them, the alternatives need to be good (as direct and point-to-point, which runs counter to LTA’s hub-and-spoke approach).\n\nIn the end, trying to incentivise “car-lite” is doomed. For car-lite policies to work, people need to have cars vs public transport as their core question. But this seems to be not the case!\n\nAs I said, people who uses public transport are forced to. A large segment who do not does so by choice and could afford it. A smaller segment can be coaxed out but the way to do it contradict current policy directions.\n\nSo where is the large segment that policies can work on and incentivise change? If they do not exist, then how can existing policies work?\n\nUnless LTA abandon efficiency-maximisation and allow more point-to-point (direct) options in public transport, car will be king and users will still fight tooth and nail against public transport.\n\nExpress trains and buses are probably some of the things that are needed to coax the car users who could be coaxed.\n\nI am sure users are willing to pay more to a degree for more direct public transport options. And by direct I do not mean the current express bus system. Those sucks because of lengthy non-express sectors and limited routes/timing, which means you are often just paying with money and time for a seat, if it is even an option for you.",

But public transport is not there yet. It is better than most countries but still not good enough. Due to the last mile and other transition factors.\n\nI wrote to LTA to suggest some options for a bus service. You see my work place is like 5 mins away (by car, about &lt;5km away and about &lt;3km from the interchange) but I need to take 3 buses to get to work (1 to interchange, then 1 from interchange to 2 bus-stops away, then the last bus is another 2 bus stops after that). I researched the route and discovered that there 5 buses from the interchange heading so close to the bus stop i need to alight at, but all turn off (1 bus stops before) reaching my destination. Note that 5 bus stops in total are all quite far apart as there are along the PIE. \n\nI asked LTA to consider having a direct bus to my work location bus stop from the interchange as based on observations, hundreds take the same route as myself every morning. I see the same faces at the interchange. LTA said no.\n\nI understand that the MRT can't cover every gap, but at least buses can. Then to my horror, I discovered I do have a direct bus from my home bus stop to my work location. But you know what? Before it reaches my work bus stop, it goes on express not stopping at my work bus stop. Wow, amazing, striking 4D would be easier. \n\nLooks like I will eventually need to drive to work which is such a waste as the distance is so near. Taking the bus is hectic (For a 60+ year old) as the last bus is always crowded and it often is late due to jams on the PIE. Going home is no ride in the park as well and it gets worst when it rains.

      "selftext": "This happened a few minutes ago and I just want to rant, so bear with me hehe\n\nI was standing under a taxi stand sign waiting for a cab. There’s no railing there, but it’s the usual informal system, the unspoken rule per se: the first person stands under the sign, others queue behind.\n\nA lady arrived after me, walked past me, and stood in front of me, maybe 4 to 5 ft away. I found it odd but didn’t immediately say anything. She was on her phone, so I thought maybe she was waiting for someone. After some time, a few people were already queueing behind me\n\nWhen a taxi came, we both flagged it. I said, \"Hello, I was here first, there’s already a queue\"\n\nShe replied, “Since when?”\n\nI said, \"Since before you arrived.\" (wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt maybe she ddnt notice but I was literally standing there the whole time in a bright coloured shirt, there's no way she didn't saw me right??, I know some might think it’s a crime, but c’mon, I like my shirt hahaha.)\n\nThere was about 5 seconds of awkward silence, and even the taxi uncle gave a small beep.\n\nThen she said, \"Ok you take lah!\" in a pretty annoyed tone. I took the taxi.\n\nNow I’m wondering, AITA for insisting? In my mind I was like, \"Not my first rodeo, lady.\" 😏 A few similar instances have happened to me before, and I tend to stand my ground if the person looks around my age.\n\nI know it’s morning rush hour and everyone’s rushing to work. But at the same time, isn’t there a basic taxi stand etiquette? Also, I realized I tend to feel more intimidated if it’s older people doing this. I get scared to confront them. But if it’s someone around my age, I can stand my ground.\n\nWas I being unreasonable for speaking up? All I want to say to the people who cut queues; I hope someone calls you out on the spot!!! And have some shame!!!",

Where are your parent’s cards and cash stored? How much money in their bank account? Do you need financial aid? Approach your nearest family service centre or Social service office for assistance. \n\n2) Valuables - Where is everyone’s passports and nrics and other valuables. In the event of a fire or housebreak-in, do you know where to find them to make sure they are still there? \n\n3) Bills- Tax, Internet, Phone, Gas, Water supply and Electricity - they should have payment instructions on their website and also a phone number to call to find out if you have outstanding bills\n\n3.5) Debt and loans - Ask your parents if they owe anyone money. Are they still repaying a car or HDB loan or insurance premium? Need to figure out how to continue w monthly payments if needed. \n\n4) Communication - If your parents are working and were detained suddenly, there might be employers or concerned friends calling wondering where they might be. Be prepared for an answer acceptable to you? If your parents were known to social service before, do you know how you can reach their social workers for help?\nIf any of your parents friends or people in their drug consumption network approach u looking for them for whatever reasons- learn how to keep urself and grandma safe in case things go sideway. \n\n5) Medicine - Check if your grandma has any medicine she needs to take daily and where they are located. Can go to her GP or polyclinic to restock as they should have her records.\n\n6) HYGIENE - A house can get dirty really fast. Clean toilet and bathroom at least once a week. Do not mix bleach with toilet cleaner!!!! It will produce toxic gases. So yah I learned that the hard way the first time I cleaned my bathroom. Please for the love of everything do not anyhow mix cleaning chemicals just because they all advertise it can clean bathrooms. \nDo not let laundry pile up.

Clear old food from refrigerators regularly - fresh fruit and veg can go bad in a week. check internet for food safety when cooking and food storage. Watch for mold. Usually if you dabao food don’t keep in fridge for more than two days. Try not to leave cooked food in room temperature for days. Also check if your containers can be microwaved - some cannot.

No shame ok there are more people willing to help someone whose parents are separated from them. Get to know your neighbours, religious community if any, and call your friends. They can help u with chores or getting stuff or just lending a listening ear. We are not meant to do this alone.\n\nJiayous!",

I was in a field role so I got the full deal of wearing a hard hat, coveralls and going up to the vessels such as rigs and FPSO etc. But I left in the end and I suggest you better leave this industry as well. Many reasons as below:\n\n\n- Safety. Saw an injury from an unintended discharge from a hydraulic line at 200-300 bar. Had a colleague who fell from a 3 storey height due to poor safety barriers erection by contractors. No amount of $$ can buy back your limbs or life.\n\n- Field work is tough and even tougher when you are older. I knew i didn’t want to be climbing up gangways or flare towers when I’m 40 plus.\n\n- Oil and gas is cyclical and I got laid off at another company when oil price crash. And given the green transition to renewable energies, this is a mega trend which is unstoppable. Oil and gas will play a smaller role in the future. \n\n- Your enemy is not AI but the decline of this industry in Singapore. This industry has been increasingly moving to other countries and we are now very far from the heydays where Keppel was renowned as a world leader for its B class jack up rigs and the yard were packed with ever increasing orders backlog and foreign workers. These days, the yards are very quiet. \n\n\nMarine vessels are dominated by Chinese and Korean yards. Rig building and vessel conversions is steadily declining in Singapore. Your future options are to move to these countries to work.

I don't know much about French real estate, but I imagine outside of Paris, it shouldn't be that expensive. \n\nFinally, I prefer the lifestyle here.

Over the last two years, I had already been traveling frequently—about 40 days per year—under my previous company’s work-from-anywhere (WFA) policy, which allowed me to test different locations across Southeast Asia. So far, I’ve spent time in various parts of Thailand, Vietnam, and most recently Cambodia.\n\nAfter being retrenched last year, I started working on my own startup, which currently earns around SGD 3,000 per month. In many Southeast Asian countries, that income allows for a relatively comfortable lifestyle.\n\nI am currently based in Cambodia and have been living here for about two months. Although Cambodia sometimes has a negative reputation due to scams or safety concerns, I’ve personally found the quality of life here to be quite decent—especially compared to Singapore. The visa process is also significantly easier than in countries like Thailand or Vietnam.\n\nIn Phnom Penh, a one-bedroom apartment with a pool and gym typically costs around SGD 700 per month, excluding utilities. Food expenses average about SGD 20–30 per day if I dine at cafés or restaurants, and can drop to around SGD 10 per day if I eat local meals.\n\nOverall, my monthly expenses are usually around SGD 2,000 if I live normally, and could be optimized further by shopping more locally. Recently, my spending went above SGD 3,000 because I’ve been exploring—visiting places like Siem Reap and Kampot, and occasionally enjoying nightlife. I’ve intentionally given myself about a year of financial runway to experiment with this lifestyle.\n\nLike you, I don’t prioritize material comfort as much as experiences. I enjoy exploring new places, nature, cafés, beaches, and different cultures. I’m also currently learning how to ride a motorbike so I can explore more independently.\n\nMy favorite places so far have been Koh Samui in Thailand and Da Nang in Vietnam. Next, I’m planning to explore Cebu City for its beaches and nightlife.\n\nUltimately, the decision is very personal. There are many countries where you can live affordably due to currency differences. I highly recommend doing a trial stay before committing long-term—living somewhere as a tourist is very different from actually living there day-to-day.\n\nHope this helps, and I’m happy to chat with anyone who’s interested in exploring this path.\n\n",

You need a better plan than just winging it and going to uni and hoping that you'll get a job after. Europe has no shortage of masters' graduates, and there's a real shortage of well-paid white-collar jobs.\n\nFor sure you can just do it for the experience, but if you really want to max the experience and make it actually meaningful, I really urge for you to plan things and perhaps consider better options (Since you're looking at Europe).",

Pay cut is not everything because you move back with international working experience which can be very valuable. \n\nLanguage wise there are not many English speaking jobs around but my role was lucky enough to be able to work in completely English (but in the end I picked up French anyway it helps massively at work lol). I would also say straight up that B1 is not enough, B2 gives you a bit of chance but for foreigners you’d need at least C1 to have a strong chance. \n\nBeyond language you also need a recognised degree because France does not recognise all university certificates+ they are minimum masters only. \n\nFriendships are not easy to come by and if you don’t speak the language you might end up only hanging out with other foreigners/expats. The loneliness you may experience is not to be estimated coupled with the administrative horrors of the French.\n\nIf you want to move make sure you’re moving for the right reasons, but generally speaking, a regular person in Singapore will probably live better than a regular person in France.

On the other side of the grandmother, there was also a boy who I assume is her brother (maybe around 10-12 years old). All of a sudden, this extremely angry woman (who I assume is their mother) stormed towards them while screaming at the top of her lungs, and when she got close to the girl, she started hitting the girl very hard while continuously yelling at the girl and the grandmother. She slapped the girl's face very hard twice and also hit her on the back while berating her in front of everyone.

I'm still thinking about it a few days later, and I'm now wondering if I should have said or done something to intervene at the moment. Again, there was a language barrier here, so l have no idea what she was so upset about, but nothing, absolutely nothing can justify slapping a child across the face so hard and hitting a child in anger like that.

      "selftext": "I’m a teen working part time at a restaurant. Before working, I have been struggling with stuttering and my memory. I can easily blank out completely and forget a conversation just that happened just a while ago (though I think is pretty common). Nontheless I thought a fast paced environment would help me to overcome these issues that I have been (still am) facing.\n\nI’ve been working for almost to 4 months, so there are certain expectations that people have of me.\n\nYesterday however, I was working a full shift. In the afternoon, I was not in the right state of mind. It was very heavy and hazy. This subsequently  affected my performance at night, despite me stationed at a position I’m very familiar with. I was so slow, pacing back and forth, and did many things wrongly. This was very unusual of me, even my coworkers realised. One of them asked me if I was okay since I seemed very stressed and not knowing what to do. At that point in time, I knew I messed up shitloads. But I still had to keep going.\n\nThat was when I was super unlucky. I accidentally cut myself with a staple bullet. I didn’t know the cut was deeper than a usual paper cut until blood started leaking on the receipts I touched. I was shocked. Those receipts were meant to be given to the customers. Thankfully though, those customers didn’t want a receipt from the start so I could keep the extra clean spare one. The problem though was that it didn’t stop bleeding for 10-15 minutes, and there were still a long line of customers who wanted to pay.\n\nBeing a cashier, you’d have to wipe the tables after helping customers to pay. Unluckily the two tables I had to wipe had pools of water customers accidentally spilled, which would take me much more time to clean. Moreover more and more customers wanted to pay, so I had to stop what I was doing and go back to the cashier.\n\nMy breaking point was when a guy ordered takeaway. He basically wanted to order a bottle of wine, but restaurant policy states that takeaway orders for wine would require customers to buy something else with it. I told him and he said he will consider. He came back and I double checked with him “So you want the red wine? A whole bottle?”, then he said, in a tone I’m not sure condescending “You mean we can order a glass of wine for takeaway”. This made me think about that one time I actually made this mistake when I was still new, so my voice just cracked and I started breaking down.\n\nLater on after closing, the same colleague asked me the same question, whether I was okay since tonight was extremely messy. This happened infront of two other colleagues. I didn’t mean to break down in front of them. I really didn’t. However, I kept thinking about my incompetence at work, how even after 4 months I couldn’t be as quick as my colleagues, and that I kept stammering. Coupled with flashbacks when my mother scolded me for being useless, incapable, and that she ultimately raised a pig. (She said this more than once). Moreover, when I’m stressed, I sometimes hear voices calling me, which makes me go crazy since sometimes I’ll walk up to customers asking if they needed anything, and my colleagues will see it as I’m walking back and forth. At that point, I just couldn’t take it anymore. I was incompetent to say the least. I was problematic and practically a burden. I wish I had the authority to deny, but looking at what’d I done, having my colleagues to resolve so many of my mistakes yesterday night, overwhelmed me with guilt.",

I noticed there are several triggers you've mentioned (eg. haze, heaviness). I have a suspicion that you are neurodivergent based on the traits you've mentioned (memory issues, stuttering, sensitivity to environmental triggers).\n\nI think this is far beyond anything a redditor can do for you, BUT what I CAN help you with is to help you make sense of things, but you must promise to go to see a doctor. Only a doctor/psychiatrist would be in the position to evaluate you and rule out other possible medical issues.\n\nThis series of events is not common nor normal, and this has caused you issues with your day to day functioning. At this point, it becomes a condition that requires professional help. Everything you're experiencing is common amongst neurodivergent people. For some of us, it's worst in childhood. The good news is that as adults, usually, things \"settle down\" a bit already.\n\nIf you want, you can DM me/ask me here and I can help you make sense of things so you can bring it to a doctor. I've been through the medical system in SG so I know the cost-efficient route. My DMs are always open ya if you feel you don't want to share too much publicly! Hugs and take care!",

As a middle aged, mid income citizen, cost of living pressures, job security, healthcare costs and care of elderly parents are real pressures. \n\nEach of these are pressure points that I feel would make me want to reconsider having children. \n\nMy parents were middle class citizens. With two working adults, they were able to afford a house and pay it off in 15 years, a car that cost about a year’s salary, and a helper. \n\nTheir parents were in their late 50s and retired when we were born which facilitated childcare arrangements. \n\nHolidays were simple affairs, mostly Malaysia and Indonesia. Only when we became teenagers did more exotic destinations like Thailand, China and Japan come into the picture. Europe and US were O-Level, A-Level grad presents. \n\nLife seemed simpler but more manageable. You bought assets, be it stocks or property, its value visibly increased over time. You could upgrade properties inline with wage growth or own a second one as rental income.\n\nLife today feels worse off, there’s no job security, asset appreciation is outpacing wage growth, even as middle income adults keeping up with cost pressures is a real challenge. \n\nThis is not a criticism of Singapore as I think we are an amazing country. I also observe the same in many other first world cities. \n\nHence I question the need to have kids in such an environment and would like to hear the thoughts of others. For those who have or who intend to have kids, can you share what gives you the confidence and strength to know you won’t mess up and can be a successful parent? ",

It feels more like a combination of multiple factors, which eventually means you will have to handle everything on your own anyhow, especially in the middle-class. What this means is that the money pressure is definitely there, since SG is a developed nation and to maintain that attractiveness, things do get expensive with our tiny piece of land. Even more so when you have growing mouths to feed, and aging mouths to take care of. \n\nBut the crux seems to be that we are now more concerned about the future of our children, and directly picking up that pressure. It is not that people are getting more selfish, self-centered and wanting to enjoy life for themselves. It is rather how do we see a brighter future where kids will flourish, how can we provide, compared to those expat children who have a lot more resources, and a home back in their country where they can go back to in case things do not work out. Our parents are in the era where hard work pays off, and they somehow have the belief that their kids will make it. It is seldom the case now. Those who have kids, are really those who love having kids, and will find ways to make it work (of course lets not consider the accidents :p) \n\nHow could it be more palatable for locals? As cost of living is always on the rise, could we have adopted the 'flexibility' for locals to perhaps own 2 properties, to stay and to rent out for growing number of foreigners, so Singaporeans can have additional income and asset? Could this help prevent casual marriages for the sake of BTOs and housing? Could we have adopted better tax benefits that help care for our seniors instead of just taxing the working class and expanding MRT lines? Or could we have better job protection to stop companies from doing layoffs for the sake of their books? \n\nUltimately there are too many considerations, and would say that if you really want to have kids, just go with it. You can never predict the future, so there is no point in trying to logic it out because you will just end up not having it. ",

He’s always been the one I can count on, as a friend. I honestly never thought he saw me as anything more than a sister.\n\nWhile we were having breakfast after gym , he suddenly became very quiet and then he just... let it all out. He told me he’s been in love with me for years. He mentioned how back in school, he used to watch all these guys chasing after me and felt so small. He said he always knew I was the girl in our batch that everyone wanted to talk to me, and he honestly thought he had no chance because I was always being pursued by the popular guys.\n\nThen he started describing things about me like he said he fell in love with my beautiful and radiant smile and how I’m the prettiest girl he’s ever known, not just because of my looks but because of my heart. The part that really killed me was when he said he only plucked up the courage to say something now because I recently broke up with my ex. He said he hated seeing another guy hurt me and it broke his heart to see me cry over someone who didn't appreciate me. He’s been holding this in for years because he didn't want to ruin our friendship, but he couldn't keep it inside anymore.\n\nGuys, I’m so lost. I’ve always treated him as a good friend only. I felt so guilty looking at his face because he looked so hopeful and vulnerable. I didn't want to reject him on Valentine's Day of all days, so I said I needed time to think. Now I feel so guilty. Did I lead him on by being so close to him? I really don't want to lose him because he's my pillar of support, but I also don't want to give him false hope. If I say no, will our friendship ever be the same? I feel so bad that he’s been suffering in silence while watching me date other people. Am I a bad person for not seeing the signs?

(theres a lot more to the leading on, obviously but im putting a generic one cos i dont know him or what makes him feel loved)\n\n2. remove the guilt. you have none. to put it simply: its his business he fell in love with you. not your business. sounds wierd and counter-intuitive, i know. \n\n3. really consider it. whether you CAN be with him or not. hes likely a good guy. he doesnt push boundaries as you can see when you were seeing someone else. thats a big green flag.\n\n4. if you cannot, just tell him straight up that you cant be with him. dont cushion the blow by saying something trite. he's a big boy and this is something that'll be good for him. (learning to deal with heartbreak, pain helps people grow, that said dont be unnecessarily cruel by flaunting future boyfriends in his face.)\n\n5. put on your big girl pants and act normally with him if you do reject him, we can tell when the woman in our lives is acting differently or wierdly. the awkwardness will come from you when you're always watching for signs of distress. remember men and women react differently. women instinctively avoid pain. men(grown ones anyway) have to embrace it cos it helps us grow. this one is important. act with him like your friend...or boyfriend if you say yes. \n\n6. whether the r/s will be the same? it likely wont be with the understandings and knowledge now in the open. but you can still be friends, just with readjusted interactions. (no staying same room, hanging out late alone, drinking heavily alone, that sort of thing, **no chance for emotions to spiral**. Yes, i had close friends growing up who liked me who I didnt like. We were CLOSE. She confessed and I had to shut it down. And i've also conversely had girls i liked who i confessed to but didnt like me back. It got shut down and things changed, not super badly or awkwardly, we just had to be adults about it.)\n\n7. false hope is you saying \"MAYBE\". and in relationships, if it aint YES, its NO. which is why i said...really consider it.\n\n  \nBe well.

      "selftext": "In **1996**, Singapore was a predominantly local society of **3.67 million people**. Singaporeans were a massive **82%** majority, meaning almost everyone shared a permanent, lifelong stake in the nation. The streets were quieter and the social fabric was uniform, as the non-resident workforce was just beginning to expand. Back then, the country functioned as a tight-knit nation-state where the vast majority of people held voting rights and a multi-generational claim to the land.\n\nIn **2026**, the population has surged to **6.15 million**, yet the citizen share has shrunk to just **59%**. While the total population grew by **68%**, the non-resident group exploded by over **530%**, reaching nearly **2 million**. This demographic shift has transformed the island into a high-pressure global hub where citizens of the country are increasingly outnumbered by transient residents. The physical density is compounded by an ageing crisis, with **21%** of citizens now **over 65**, leaving a smaller core of local stakeholders to navigate an unrecognisably crowded city.\n\nCrucially, the **59%** citizen figure is **deceptive** because it ignores the distinction between natural-born and naturalised citizens. The data masks the influx of adults who may not share the local culture or have served National Service (for males). This internal shift means the proportion of \"traditional\" stakeholders with deep roots is even lower than official stats suggest. Today, the [native-born](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/native-born) Singaporean finds themselves in a city where nearly **1 in 3 people** is a temporary guest, fundamentally altering the sense of home that existed thirty years ago.\n\n_________\n**Tl;DR:** Since **1996**, Singapore's population has hit close to **6.2 million** while the citizen stake diluted from **82% to 59%**. This **59%** includes many new citizens who didn't grow up locally or serve NS, meaning traditional stakeholders now share a much denser country with **2 million** non-residents. How much lower will this figure go in another three decades?\n_______\n\nOfficial Data Sources: [Singstat](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/) (For Censuses held decennially, [latest in 2020](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/publications/reference/cop2020/cop2020-sr1)) and [National Population and Talent Division](https://www.population.gov.sg/) (For Population In Briefs held annually, [latest in 2025](https://www.population.gov.sg/files/media-centre/publications/Population_in_Brief_2025.pdf) and [visual by ST](https://i.imgur.com/gH7Ynnh.png)).",

These names are based on hard to compile sources (word of mouth, forums, Telegram, Lemon8, etc). The aim is to share information so that others can do their own due diligence before committing. Along with the names, I'll try my best to include links to where the discussions took place so you can verify yourself. These are rarely available depending on where it was sourced from.\n\nNote: some of these experiences were with certain individual IDs within these firms, so you may still have a good experience if you engage the right person. There’s also the possibility that IDs move between firms, so please always do your own diligence. However, if you’ve had experiences where the workmanship itself was poor, do mention it - as that usually points to the contractors used by the firm as a whole, not just the individual ID.\n\nIf you are an ID/contractor reading this, please note this list reflects individual experiences and feedback - not absolute fact - and I encourage homeowners to always research further.\n\nHere’s the current list (please add on if you’ve come across others or PM me directly):\n\n1.

Also found this [comment](https://imgur.com/jSyGsSw) who has a [compiled list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XO_g2vto4NBQ_Ugln6ZRNT_WSX9EYDF0Vp6wCzDFpWo/edit?usp=sharing) as well.\n\nUPDATED (as of 2026): I've realised that some firms branched/split off their mothership, so I've put them together in the same line. That way homeowners can better assess (since it’s very probable that reviews of the mothership would apply to the subsidiary/split firm). Also note that even though this post has been made some time ago, I update it frequently whenever I find more or ppl reach out.",

I felt that Mr Andrew Chan’s comment was so well written.\n\nMr Chan said the whole chunk below:\n\n“Your power of inference is very weak.\n\nPeople make references to CECA because there has obviously been a strong resentment of an over import of these immigrants here. Locally born Singaporeans’ jobs have been affected. Many of the immigrants have also been granted PRs and citizenship without clear justification.\n\nThe unhappiness with immigrants is a natural reaction. It’s also displayed in Japan, Europe, Australia and Canada.\n\nI don’t think the general Singaporean is racist. Stop calling them that. This isn’t purely racism.\n\nYou cannot deny the general population’s anger when many people of different nationalities with fake degrees and bad cultural practices come over to take away jobs. You probably don’t feel it because you are retired.\n\nIt seems to me also that you don’t drive at all. It’s baffling how strong the impact of the car could be at that small road unless the driver was speeding and driving recklessly. You mean people are not supposed to feel angry about this?\n\nAnd go read the article carefully again: After knocking down the hapless child, her car moved again and rolled over the abdomen of her mother. Was it twice?\n\nWho drives like this?\n\nOh Bertha, you are saying people shouldn’t feel angry? You are such an angel hor. No apologies here, but we are humans here with emotions.

      "selftext": "Hi, long time lurker first time poster, using a burner account. I’m in my mid 30s and after working for a little over a decade, I’ve managed to accumulate about SGD 2 mil in liquid assets (not including my house and CPF). The screenshot provides some proof (my equity account). I don’t have generational wealth, but I’m very financially secure. \n\nThis financial security has made my life much, much better. These are my 3 favourite things about getting rich. \n\n1. **I can prioritise life over work.** \n\nMy kids had a bout of illness recently and I took time off work to care for them. As I went through my calendar for the month, I realised that on average, I had worked four days or less each week. And more importantly, I was never stressed about what this might mean for my work or my performance.\n\nThis mindset and ability to let go are new to me. I’ve always put my best into school and work, and this paid off. I scored well, got a high paying job, and promoted fast. But as my salary grew so did my stress, my belly, and the number of friendships I lost. So over the past two years I’ve consciously traded work to reverse these trends and spend more time with my family.\n\nWork-life balance looks different for everyone. I like but I don’t love my work, so having the peace of mind from my finances to no longer feel a strong need to work has absolutely done wonders for me. My family, health, and social life have taken priority over my work, and I feel a lot happier most days. \n\n2. **I have a portfolio that lets me sleep well at night**\n\nSince this is r/singaporefi I guess I should share my current portfolio. It’s roughly: 65% equities (LSE ETFs), 30%  cash and bonds, and 5% gold. \n\nCan I optimize my portfolio? Definitely. Given my age I should allocate more to riskier assets, maybe even crypto. In fact, I got rich not just through high savings from a high paying job, but also because my old portfolio was almost 100% equities with many stock picks (big tech) that did very well. \n\nBut my old portfolio was too risky and I often lost sleep over it. No longer. After crossing the SGD 1.5 mil mark I rebalanced it slowly to where it is now and I have never lost any sleep over my portfolio since then. Yet the returns on my suboptimised portfolio last year covered my \n\nentire annual expense. \n\nAnd that’s one of the best things about being rich. I don’t need to take financial risks. I don’t need to chase high returns. I don’t need to care about vagaries of the market. I can just do whatever preserves my wealth and lets me sleep best at night.\n\n3. **I spend whatever I want on people and things that make my life better.**\n\nMy family and I went to MBS last year. When we arrived we realised that we had forgotten one of our kids’ shoes. Driving home or letting kiddo walk around barefooted weren’t options. So we just waltzed into one of the atas MBS kids shop and picked up a ridic overpriced pair of kids shoes. In our calculus, it was more than worth it to spend three digits to save the effort of carrying our chonky kid around the whole day. \n\nI can’t afford to buy a GCB or a sports car or fancy watches. But I can take grab everywhere, order ala carte at restaurants, and fly premium economy. I can splurge on experiences like holidays and musicals with my parents and wife and kids. I can throw money at problems and buy time and convenience. And to me, these things are the best uses of money, and one of the greatest perks of being rich. \n\n——\n\nTL;DR Life gets much better as you get rich, but only if you let it.\n\nGood luck everyone!

Dragged 3mths and i finally called police and needed 1mth for appointment. 2hours of checking and statement recording. Been almost 1mth soon, and now waiting for update.\n\nYou see, people transfer you money and they report they got scammed or something illegal, then every single account transacted to/from will be frozen for investigation. This is a joke because you can be screw just by receiving money. Police told me the right thing is to contact bank when you get any unkown money. Not reporting is wrong. From OP, seems like reporting doesn't work too. Very bad SOP.\n\nIf not for my cpfis and srs i probably would ignore dbs for much much longer.\n\nEdit: the culprit was due to 1 transfer in of abt $150.",

In a Junior Manager Post\n\n3. Looking for courses to upgrade myself to move into sectors / industries which pays more. \n\nIntrinsic motivation:\n\n1. Getting married soon and planning for kids \n\n2. Retiring my parents (blue collar workers and are not as physically fit anymore)\n\nExtrinsic motivation:\n\n1. Different friend groups were sharing on salary recently and I find myself on the lower end when we were comparing. The next guy/girl “ranking” above me (from different groups) were drawing around $7k while being 1 - 2 years younger than me. One friend on highest end is drawing like $10k and 3 years younger than me.\n\nSo what are some of the good paying jobs I could go into and the skillsets I need to obtain prior to applying for them so that I can raise my salary range.

      "selftext": "Hi all, don't come to this sub very often, but someone commented to me that there's this misconception about funds, and it's actually a pet peeve of mine, so I thought I would drop an explainer.\n\nI've been in the fund industry for quite a while, mostly on the operation side and I would want to clarify something about dividends. Basically, I find that a lot of Singaporeans like to chase dividends in funds, sometimes to an irrational level. \n\nBasically how a fund would is the money from all the investors are pulled to buy shares. This allow investors to gain broad exposure to investments, some that they do not have direct access to. Other than ETFs which trade on the market, it should be noted that the fund price that you regularly see is based on the fund's investment portfolio, along with operational cash-equivalent entries (cash, receivables, payables). ETF are also priced this way, but because it's traded on a board, the trading price may move from the calculated price, but generally not to a big degree.\n\nNow, back to dividends. When a fund pays dividends, it is from a fund's assets. It will pay from it's cash, and if that is insufficient, it will sell some stocks to make up the difference. The corresponding effect is that a fund price will always fall after paying out the dividend, unless its portfolio movement makes up the difference.\n\nStocks are paid at investor's perceived value of the company and expected future cashflows. Dividends paid from stocks can have a positive impact on the perceived value and increase the stock price even when stocks pay out dividends. This does not happen with funds. Funds pay out dividends from assets that are already yours. You don't magically gain any value from dividends other than cashflow, which could be a valid reason to wanting dividends from some people.\n\nNow, something that even fewer people knows about. Dividends cost money to the fund. Fund administrators (the ones doing the operational work for the fund managers) typically charge a fee for each transaction to the fund. This includes dividends. And note that this is for each transaction. That means a flat fee is typically charged for each dividend transaction paid to each receiving investor. Typically, you are paying a small amount for each dividend you received. \n\nSo there you have it. Hope this post helps people understand the underlying mechanics a bit better and make wiser decisions.\n\n",

The gains should out weight the depreciation, as US equities tend to go up if USD devalues. Compared to the flat line SGX if you pick say the last ten years other than the the recent two years and compare the Snp for the same period. Devalued USD also means you're buying more units so if you DCA I guess it would sort itself out. Just don't beileve your x% gain in USD so much.

A somewhat deflationary mindset is beginning to set in -- no 'urgency' to consume now since inflation remains very low, and intense competition plus over-production from excess capacity means prices continue falling over time. This is why some are cautioning that China may fall into a similar deflationary spiral like Japan in the 90s, if more is not done to reform the economy.\n\nThere are also signs that China is experiencing a \"liquidity trap\". 30-year bond yields are ~2.2%, but credit impulse has not picked up meaningfully. Cuts to the RRR (reserve req ratio) unleashing liquidity into the financial system have not been meaningfully stimulatory.\n\nStock market-wise, it is quite clear policymakers are trying to engineer a gradual market rally, whilst trying to boost household participation in stocks in hopes of spurring consumption through the wealth effect. The \"National Team\" has been selling stocks so far this year (they were big buyers in 2024 to support the market). For Hong Kong-listed equities, daily southbound net buying through the StockConnect has materially slowed, and certainly days are actually seeing outflows. More importantly, earnings have not materially grown y/y at the index level, so last year's rally was mostly driven by valuation multiple expansion.\n\nGiven current circumstances, it seems that a slow grind higher in Chinese stocks is the most likely outcome for this year, barring a trade war re-escalation. We may come to a point where \"bad is good\" -- poor data forces policymakers to rollout more stimulus, that should ultimately benefit the stock market. Also quite unlikely that Chinese stocks catch up to their East Asian breathren given the absence of the AI thematic (Korea/Taiwan) or broad fiscal stimulus (Japan).",

For example, you could save money and eat the absolute bare minimum for food, but that itself is not a good diet and instead you are killing yourself faster by eating poorly. Would it not make sense to buy healthier, organic food that taste just as good but fuels your body properly? \n\nYou can eat dory fish which is just solid fishy water with little nutrients or you can buy fishes like salmon, cod or herring or mackerel which is healthier and taste better but it cost more. In that situation, the dollar value of spending more far outweighs the dollar value of saving because the dollar value you save doesn't pay for the lost in health. You enjoy food more because the food is nicer and these are the situations where lifestyle inflation makes sense. \n\nThis can be applied to everything, the goal isn't to spend more for the sake of spending more. The goal is to optimise the dollar value spent to benefit you the most. Look at the things you have in your life, it is sometimes worth asking, what is best possible version of the thing you can have? \n\nAnother example, I have is pants. Many people here will end up buying uniqlo pants because it's cheap and looks okay. But uniqlo is fast fashion, a pair of jogger i brought would pill and rip within the year because the material is so bad. That led me down the rabbit hole of pants, from dickies work wear carpenter pants to raw denim jeans. (I was into raw denim before raw denim was a trend) this has led me to spending hundreds into a single pair of jeans and hundreds more into extremely high quality pants. With all the pants I brought, i am set for the next 10 years. They will last me longer than any uniqlo pants could.",
