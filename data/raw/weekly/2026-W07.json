While walking through the car park near the Chinese temple at Maxwell MRT, I witnessed a traffic accident at around 11:40 a.m. today. It was the first time in my life that I saw a traffic accident happen right in front of me.\n\n&gt;I was the first person walking behind the mother and her daughter. A woman was driving out from the car park. She did not look to the right for pedestrians; she only looked to the left when she turned right. The front wheel of her car ran over the little girl’s abdomen first, then over the mother’s leg. After that, the woman pressed the accelerator hard, and the rear wheel ran over the mother’s abdomen again.\n\n&gt;I don’t know why she accelerated so quickly when she just exited the car park. I guess they might be tourists. I can help as a witness and testify about this traffic accident.\n\n&gt;I clearly saw that when the front wheel ran over them, the driver should have felt that there was something under the wheel. However, she did not stop to get out of the car to check. Instead, she accelerated strongly and continued to drive forward, which caused the rear wheel to run over the mother’s abdomen again.\n\n&gt;I panicked at that moment and cannot remember clearly whether the rear wheel ran over the little girl again. I was in shock when the incident happened right in front of me.\n\n&gt;At the time of the accident, the husband was not with them. Only the mother and daughter were there, and I was walking behind them. About two minutes later, the husband ran over and hugged the little girl.\n\n&gt;When the front wheel ran over the little girl, she was thrown and rolled about three times and ended up lying face down on the ground. Her mouth was in a pool of blood, next to her water bottle and her camera. The blood was flowing heavily from her mouth and spread thickly on the road.\n\n&gt;When the woman got out of the car and went to the back to check, she then realized that she had caused the accident.

Unless something is done to address it, people will continue to think that cars are better (because they are).\n\nThen, people will get angry as public transport quality declines.\n\nAs of now, the main reason stopping people from far flung areas switching to cars is the high cost, not because it is not logical (it is in fact very logical for you to want to switch, if you can afford it).\n\nThat and people living further out tend to be less wealthy.\n\nIn other countries and cities, jams and heavy traffic forces the car option to be equally shit, so there is no “alternative”, whether you can pay your way out or not.\n\nHere, people are priced out by design. Urban planning and car policies forces non-wealthy citizens into public transport and remove alternatives.\n\nThe barrier is not because people like public transport! It is because although someone can take 1/3 the time of their usual (peak) commute to travel by say taxi, it is financially unfeasible because it costs almost $100 a day to do so for some areas.\n\nThe layout of our country forces poor people to the far out area, concentrating the relatively wealthy people around the central core.\n\nThis made it seems like we are controlling car usage by forcefully locking in people who are more likely to switch away from public transport by pricing them out out private transport.\n\nThen, the wealthy people who do drive have less incentives to switch from cars, because they are not going to switch to the public transport option anyway even if it is competitive. Their trade off was never really about commute time, so how can you incentivise them out of cars even if you built a MRT station in their front porch?\n\nThen, the non-wealthy people who still overcame high cost to buy cars will try to maximise their value, so they will keep using and get pissed if the value of using cars is infringed.\n\nPrice them out, they get angry because the alternative really sucks and you are forcing them out without giving them a fair alternative. To cater to them, the alternatives need to be good (as direct and point-to-point, which runs counter to LTA’s hub-and-spoke approach).\n\nIn the end, trying to incentivise “car-lite” is doomed. For car-lite policies to work, people need to have cars vs public transport as their core question. But this seems to be not the case!\n\nAs I said, people who uses public transport are forced to. A large segment who do not does so by choice and could afford it. A smaller segment can be coaxed out but the way to do it contradict current policy directions.\n\nSo where is the large segment that policies can work on and incentivise change? If they do not exist, then how can existing policies work?\n\nUnless LTA abandon efficiency-maximisation and allow more point-to-point (direct) options in public transport, car will be king and users will still fight tooth and nail against public transport.\n\nExpress trains and buses are probably some of the things that are needed to coax the car users who could be coaxed.\n\nI am sure users are willing to pay more to a degree for more direct public transport options. And by direct I do not mean the current express bus system. Those sucks because of lengthy non-express sectors and limited routes/timing, which means you are often just paying with money and time for a seat, if it is even an option for you.",

But public transport is not there yet. It is better than most countries but still not good enough. Due to the last mile and other transition factors.\n\nI wrote to LTA to suggest some options for a bus service. You see my work place is like 5 mins away (by car, about &lt;5km away and about &lt;3km from the interchange) but I need to take 3 buses to get to work (1 to interchange, then 1 from interchange to 2 bus-stops away, then the last bus is another 2 bus stops after that). I researched the route and discovered that there 5 buses from the interchange heading so close to the bus stop i need to alight at, but all turn off (1 bus stops before) reaching my destination. Note that 5 bus stops in total are all quite far apart as there are along the PIE. \n\nI asked LTA to consider having a direct bus to my work location bus stop from the interchange as based on observations, hundreds take the same route as myself every morning. I see the same faces at the interchange. LTA said no.\n\nI understand that the MRT can't cover every gap, but at least buses can. Then to my horror, I discovered I do have a direct bus from my home bus stop to my work location. But you know what? Before it reaches my work bus stop, it goes on express not stopping at my work bus stop. Wow, amazing, striking 4D would be easier. \n\nLooks like I will eventually need to drive to work which is such a waste as the distance is so near. Taking the bus is hectic (For a 60+ year old) as the last bus is always crowded and it often is late due to jams on the PIE. Going home is no ride in the park as well and it gets worst when it rains.

This was 18 years ago. \n\nFast forward to 2024, my poly friend's wedding, she and her husband are expats. Both are in good stages of their careers, not rich but well to do as career is in good place. They paid for our bridesmaid dresses, bride let us choose from Shein and she bought them for us, meet us for a dinner while she passed us the dress 👗 (she treated us the dinner, while we delegated the bridesmaid work, who takes care of what, who recce the place while joining the bride and groom for menu tasting, who is bridesmaid of honor and so on)\n\nDuring pre wedding decor we all woke up super early (as its a lunch), we did our own makeup and hair, help to decorate the wedding lunch space. Help each other (bridesmaids, there are about 6 of us) with hair and makeup. We bring our own decorations to contribute, like i bought a bubble gun and solution, fairy lights and flower petals, out of my own pocket.\n\nWe bridesmaids also give ang baos for the wedding lunch. It was at Andaz, I gave a $288 angbao, with $2 notes from the flower series (older singapore notes), cause my mum has some old notes. Some bridesmaids who are closer to bride, like a workplace bestie bought her a customised jewellery piece on top of ang bao.\n\nAfter the wedding lunch, we joined the bride and groom and his friends from the country he's from, for a dinner by the fullerton riverside, as a compensation from the bride and groom. Bride and groom gave us a small wedding gift bag, which the bride's sister prepared on their behalf, with a $50 ang bao. \n\nI'm sharing, because i feel everyone's life experiences are different. And at the end of the day, bridesmaid duty is quite heavy, choose wisely who you are a bridesmaid for. It is okay to reject being a bridesmaid if you think you dont not have the bandwidth. \n\nAnd depending on how close you are to the bride, like my good friend despite in the midst of divorce she still find the mental strength and bandwidth to be a bridesmaid. This is because she is very good friend with the bride, and the bride is not chinese, who is not pantang whether a \"divorcee\" will pass the luck to the newlyweds. Like they are such good friends, nothing stands in the way for them celebrate for the bride's union joys. \n\nOP, revisit why you become a bridesmaid moving forward.

I can relate, my parents divorced when I was young and both remarried other people. For a long time it felt like I was the unwanted the child, the uncomfortable reminder of a life they both choose to forgot. But I looked at their life choices (relationship wise), at the people they became, and I told myself that I never wanted to become like them. I was single for a very long time before I met my spouse, and we've been together for over a decade now. \n\nOfc when you are young (and you ARE young!), it is easy to think that a relationship would become your shelter from the world. But that isn't the answer. Growing up, I spent a lot of time by myself. I think that's when you learn who you are as a person, when you develop your own inner world. Being by yourself forces you to be comfortable in your own skin.  So don't be afraid to be alone. You might be stronger than you think. Focus on healing yourself first. Focus on giving yourself space and time to process your upbringing. Going through what you did at a young age means you started life on hard mode - you gotta accept that and process it and move forward accordingly. Money can always be earned back, but a peaceful life is priceless. \n\nYou've got this.\n\nSigned,\nOne traumatised kid to another.",

My younger sister also had kids (granted she was 21 years old then). \n\nI wanted at least a few years to assess the guy. If I’m gonna marry him for life, I need to ensure the dating phase is as healthy as possible, non toxic relationship. This is very important because I am deathly afraid of being divorced. \n\nI feel like you’re jumping to any guy that falls in love with you then straight away bto. If you’re dating to marry, you need to look at everything objectively and long term. How is the guy and his career (does he have goals) , how you guys quarrel (is it in a healthy manner), what is his value in religion and kids, how you guys deal with difficult conversations, what is his financial philosophy (does he not save), etc.. Because it’s not just about feelings anymore. I have a few criteria that the guy has to meet else I’ll drop them, even at the first date. My friends said going on dates with me is like going for an interview. Maybe I got serious fear of divorce, I need to 100% ensure my husband will be the right choice for me. I even went to pre marital course with my husband just for a third party to assess our relationship. \n\nMarrying the right one at a later age is better than marrying the wrong one early. Personally, I look at my own relationship and I feel so blessed to have met the one. I’m glad that I didn’t settle for any Tom, dick or harry. \n\nBto wise…. Husband first. Logistic second.

He also felt that I gained too much weight - this was when I realised the love was conditional af. And we too, selected our BTO. It was a lot of pain, but luckily the loss was only a few grand, we didn't pay the downpayment yet. In the grand scheme of things, I am glad I dodged a bullet. Because later the down the line, a divorce would be messy and more expensive than a few grand. Rather be happy single than in an unhappy marriage.\n\nWhat worked for me was that I realised that nobody actually gives a fuck about you lol as in no one is caring about whether you look good in front of them or not. Because I have realised that I don't really care much about other people, so I think the same of how other people would see me. The earlier you realise this, and let go of all of these thoughts about comparing yourself to other people, the earlier you will become happier.\n\nSecondly, sorry this might be a bit out of touch but when you can afford it: travel - lots of solo travel to random places fixed me; travelling with friends and making the best memories is also super amazing.

But became middle upper after.\n\n1. Don’t splurge. The temptations to literally throw ur money for ego and pride is a killer. Whatever you buy has no value except its logo. If you die die want one for looks. Then it’s an insecurity. Parents had this and splurged on unnecessary things.\n\n2. Children payments expenses. Tuition, welfare, maid, etc; understand the need for a helper/maid since parents might be busy. With tuition you can definitely find good ones within a budget means. And more importantly it’s the child’s brain development. Understanding how children learn and associate knowledge to memory and primary motor function would literally have more worth than just throwing things ur child’s way.\n\n3. House mortgage/ car mortgage. Parents once again switch cars when and how they want. From Benz to BMW. And back. General rule of thumb is can you afford it 10x if you can then go for it buddy.\n\n4. Money decisions. What my parents didn’t consider was growth factor and change in business climate. So they don’t have backend extra cash to tide over rough seasons. Or to evolve the business to e-commerce (2015 period) \n\n5. Cash could have went to passive income. There’s good debt and bad debt. Good debt helps you earn more money to pay it off. Parents could have laid a portion of cash, while getting a landed or condo to rent it out for extra passive income.\n\n6. Family relations. Family relations sour from the knowledge of money. My father is quite mommas boy. He side with my grandma more than my mom and because of that relationship sour. Relatives knew he operate the business with my mom. And how much they were earning and always gave “opinions” and wanted a slice of the pie. Until it all went crashing down. Please draw boundaries.\n\n7. Over commitment to secondary relatives. This is parents and siblings. Once you have kids and a wife. Your commitment and primary family is them. You start from scratch with morals and principles you want to put into this family. Over commitment to your siblings and parents. Will blind you and put you in a bind financially, slowly affecting your primary family. And making your life difficult.\n\n7b.) your siblings and parents are able to raise themselves unless they’re disabled or ill. If they’re having difficulties or are in a tight patch. Temporary help is fine. However long term commitment when they’re grown adults responsible, it’s just you unable to say no. Parents will have to retire and you will have to give an allowance and help raise them. However you have siblings who do that too. So make sure it’s equal. Or you all come to an agreement. \n\nThis is all my take upvote or downvote. This is my experience growing up in a well to do family who came crashing down into middle SES. I don’t say this to criticise and hate my parents just a very non personal understanding and analysis of behaviors I wouldn’t bring into my family when I start it. And how we operate financially too.",

Just bear in mind that you'd have to pay an additional +$15k on top of your flat cost  (i call it the singles tax). You can consider taking HDB's optional component scheme (opting in flooring, wash basin/shower fittings) which is another add on $3.3K - $3.5K (?) if you want some cost savings (&amp; are not picky).

          "text": "I can’t say how true some people’s statements here are, but you should always take them with a pinch of salt. When it comes to salary, anyone can claim they earn this or that.\n\nIn banking, if someone claims they entered using a private degree, are not doing insurance or sales, and are earning 70–80k, most of the time that is pure nonsense — unless you are in FO. Even IB starting pay is not that high for middle- and back-office support roles.\n\nOf course if they are engineering doing coding and developer that one is different story. I saying pure banking and finance back and middle role\n\nHere’s my take: private vs local degree does matter at the start, and it also depends heavily on HR. The past market and today’s market are completely different. In the past, HR did the filtering. If your HR happened to be from the same school or background, they might still present you to the hiring manager. Today, you go through ATS first, then HR — meaning AI filters you before a human even sees your résumé.\n\nI know this because I just left my previous job and applied recently. I was rejected via automated email, but one recruiter later picked up my résumé and presented it directly to the hiring manager and HR. I got called and managed to secure an interview. That’s why past and present cannot be compared. Most of my roles were honestly secured through recruiters referring me in.\n\nI am an overseas graduate. I managed to enter an MNC, then switched industries into banking, jumping every one to two years with pay increments. I even entered a top IB on a short-term contract, and honestly, they paid me quite well for my experience and support role. IB is not easy to enter — even for local university graduates. As contractors, we still had to go through two to three interview rounds, with heavy emphasis on self-learning ability and pressure handling.\n\nAnother thing people underestimate: colleagues matter more than your degree after you enter. If you want to get promoted fast, you need capable juniors who learn quickly, and teammates who actually contribute instead of free-riding. Sometimes promotion happens simply because someone survives longer in the role. That’s how you end up with leaders who don’t really know what they are doing.\n\nThat’s why you must learn to push back. Private degree doesn’t define your ceiling, but you must protect yourself from burnout and unreasonable workload dumping. Some banking environments promote based on seniority, others on skillset. Having experienced IB, local banks, and global brokerages, I can say clearly: different places have very different views on degrees, performance, and promotion.\n\nSo always take Reddit comments — especially salary and career claims. It just how you manage to navigate the company environment that all. I would say choose a good mentor first than depends on what colleague you work with and see how and what type of people the bank promote. If is seniority than having stay in the bank for yrs works. If is skill than continuous study in banking is very important as finance is really very big. Even up to now I am still occasionally doing ibf test and exam.\n\nLast of all degree only matter at start. Getting good colleague and mentor is important. Knowing how to navigate the office environment is even more important",

          "text": "Private uni grad here and here's my story:\n\n\\- After O's, I did my diploma and advanced diploma in an institution located at Queenstown. Stopped after that to go out and work mainly because the institution discontinued one of their degree programmes (which I wanted to take) and recommended the students to take another one which was twice as ex. Finding a decent job was hard with only a private diploma and most of the job offers were usually entry-level + low salary, but no choice, I had to suck it up.\n\n\\- Decided to do something about the situation and went to a different private institute. They recommended this: (1) do a short foundation programme + degree, or (2) a 1 year diploma + degree. I opted for (2) as the price of the foundation programme and the diploma was almost the same (just a few hundred dollars difference). My degree qualification was a combination of human resource and psychology.\n\n\\- After graduation, my degree really did open up doors for me. My first job after graduation was in a very highly specialised HR function in an MNC.\n\n\\- After some years, I decided to branch away from HR and had my first stint in social services (SPED).\n\n\\- Over the years, I have had several other jobs (also had to take a few career breaks to care for my ageing parents) and I have also worked in govt - incidentally, this was also where I managed to climb the ladder and become a manager.\n\n\\- I also did a qualification in career counselling in a local poly, and it helped me secure a senior role in SPED as I have always been passionate about this field. Again, grateful that my degree + post diploma combi helped me to progress in my career.\n\n\\- I am currently pursuing a psychology-related masters at one of the local universities (yes the Big 3). I was very doubtful that my HR-related, non-honours degree would meet the university's entry requirement, so it was a pleasant surprise when I received the acceptance offer.\n\nPublic or private, it ultimately boils down to how you brand and market yourself to employers. I will admit that in the early years of my career, I have been envious of some friends who were also from private institutes who always got the nice cushy jobs while I was stuck in shitty jobs. But it was when I started upgrading myself and levelling up did I realise that I too, am capable of being a desirable candidate to employers. (Tip: ALWAYS TAILOR YOUR RESUME - I have a folder FULL of different formats of resumes! Lol!)\n\nI am sharing all of this information not to toot my own horn, but to let people in similar circumstances as myself know that career success is still possible with a private degree. When I was younger, I had a lot of self doubts and even had moments where I've thought to myself like wth am I doing with my life. It took years of hard work, coursework assignments, late nights (I studied p/t while working f/t) and shitty bosses before things started falling into place and at that time, I didn't even realise it. It was when I went for my interview for the govt job that I realised that the people there were really interested in my unique blend of working experiences, and I ended up getting an offer within two days.\n\nLastly, not everyone's education and career path will be linear; some of us will job hop or pivot to unrelated fields, and this is perfectly normal and alright.. Eventually we will find things that we are passionate about, and even if we don't, we would ultimately find something that we won't mind doing - this is something I learnt in my career counselling course :)",

The societal system in India allows the upper caste to get away with all kinds of crimes. Now, when a pro-CECA government like PAP shields these people, it further amplifies their ego that they are sovereign and above the law. Previous Ceca cases such as Ramesh Erramalli who worked in JP Morgan with a fake degree, has shown the other Cecas in Singapore that they can abuse people and get away with it. Hence, I have absolutely no faith in the justice system that this Ceca driver would get the appropriate punishments.\n\nOn my part, I don't support any pro-CECA party otherwise I won't be able to sleep at night, the PAP MPs who knock on my door every GE knows that I only have one request, that's to abolish CECA for the collective benefit of Singaporeans, I told them not to bother speaking to me until CECA is abolished, then overtime the door knock stops, because they know this request is impossible to fulfill as it's their fundamental core policy which is existential to their political survival.",

While walking through the car park near the Chinese temple at Maxwell MRT, I witnessed a traffic accident at around 11:40 a.m. today. It was the first time in my life that I saw a traffic accident happen right in front of me.\n\nI was the first person walking behind the mother and her daughter. A woman was driving out from the car park. She did not look to the right for pedestrians; she only looked to the left when she turned right. The front wheel of her car ran over the little girl’s abdomen first, then over the mother’s leg. After that, the woman pressed the accelerator hard, and the rear wheel ran over the mother’s abdomen again.\n\nI don’t know why she accelerated so quickly when she just exited the car park. I guess they might be tourists. I can help as a witness and testify about this traffic accident.\n\nI clearly saw that when the front wheel ran over them, the driver should have felt that there was something under the wheel. However, she did not stop to get out of the car to check. Instead, she accelerated strongly and continued to drive forward, which caused the rear wheel to run over the mother’s abdomen again.\n\nI panicked at that moment and cannot remember clearly whether the rear wheel ran over the little girl again. I was in shock when the incident happened right in front of me.\n\nAt the time of the accident, the husband was not with them. Only the mother and daughter were there, and I was walking behind them. About two minutes later, the husband ran over and hugged the little girl.\n\nWhen the front wheel ran over the little girl, she was thrown and rolled about three times and ended up lying face down on the ground. Her mouth was in a pool of blood, next to her water bottle and her camera. The blood was flowing heavily from her mouth and spread thickly on the road.\n\nWhen the woman got out of the car and went to the back to check, she then realized that she had caused the accident. She raised her voice at the father while their daughter was injured and kept trying to explain that she was not at fault.",

He looked super lost and kept waving his hand like he needed help, so i thought ok lor he’s blind and the crossing is quite busy, might as well help.\n\nWhen the light turned green i went over and let him hold my arm, but THE MOMENT i stepped off the kerb he literally wrapped his arm around my waist and squeezed me DAMN tight. i was honestly damn shocked but we were in the middle of the road and there were cars turning, so i just suck it up and thought maybe he’s just scared of falling?\n\nafter we crossed he didn’t let go and started saying his leg very painful and asked if i can help him tie his shoelaces. then he suddenly say he very thirsty and need water. i told him i can run to 7-11 buy one for him but he insisted on having MY water. i felt bad since he’s \"blind\" right so i just took my bottle out and passed to him.\n\nguys... he didn't even pour it into his mouth. he literally put his ENTIRE LIPS all over the rim and drank it like that. i was so grossed out but i just told myself maybe he cannot see where the opening is?\n\nthen i guided him to a bench nearby to tie his laces like he asked. i was wearing a spaghetti top today because the weather is literally warm... so i bent down to reach his shoes. when i looked up to ask if it was tight enough, i caught him STAIRING straight down my top. his eyes were literally focused.\n\ni quickly stood up and said i need to go class already. i walked away quite fast but i looked back after a bit and i saw him UNCLE WAS LITERALLY SCROLLING HIS PHONE AND WALKING WITH NO CANE NO NOTHING.\n\ni feel so stupid and violated and thought i was doing a good deed but i think i just got played by a creep. Please stay safe folks!",

My work thus far in the public service for an economic related Ministry/Statboard has been so bad and I honestly preferred my time serving NS in my chiong sua combat unit…. If I had known what it’d be like I would’ve passed on the scholarship and gone to local U happily\n\nMicromanaging bosses, meaningless paper pushing work, bizarre SOPs and internal office initiatives are bad enough. Realizing that I’m not developing any skills and that I will be so irrelevant to any decent company outside govt/SG after my bond is another thing entirely. I believe in helping the public and volunteer extensively outside in my local CC, so I came into the job a year ago with lots of enthusiasm but now I feel completely dead inside. I sense that my leaders + bosses + colleagues are mostly very uninspirational and do not care about excellence or actually creating impactful outcomes at work - they’re happy to show up and skate by on the bare minimum. Comparing this to NS in the army (which is also a govt organisation): at least I genuinely respected some of my NS regulars who were really damn good at certain aspects of their intense job. I can’t say the same about ANYONE where I work.\n\nWhile abroad, I interned at pretty good MNCs and had return offers, but of course I couldn’t take them due to the bond. Saw all my friends go on to earn big bucks but more importantly, open up way more doors for their future career trajectory by starting their career in coveted roles. Despite being initially promised exciting exposure to policy and shaping national strategies when I signed the scholarship, I’m now working in ultra-generalist menial roles that I genuinely think a secondary school kid could do. Feel like I was sold lies coming out of JC as I haven’t used my brain since joining or learnt a single useful thing that’d give me any leverage in the job market if I wanted to leave. The other scholars around and above me are all either resigned to their fate, or also horrendously unhappy. Why did the govt pay $500k for each of us to come back and rot?\n\nI feel like I’ve been pushed and pushed myself my whole life to excel ambitiously. But in govt, there’s hardly a no point (or benchmark) for achieving excellence because my work is so slow and detached from driving real outcomes, and the bonus structure doesn’t give me any real incentive to do so. This would be a great job if all I wanted to do was lepak and collect the steady paycheck but I feel like I am just wasting my life.\n\nI have actually made some money trading stocks and I am in a position to break my bond soon, am recruiting very heavily to get out of it which provides some solace. But man does it make me sad to realise how much time I wasted, and how the system here is wasting their human capital investments.\n\nAlmost every overseas scholar I’ve met across agencies and through friends hates their life and shares similar sentiments. Especially those that made the most of their experience abroad and didn’t just stay to the SG bubble.\n\nThe people at the top need to seriously re-examine how they develop talent or even hand out these scholarships - the current system is a product of a bygone era and sticking to it just will create a massive adverse selection problem for our country’s future. When your ‘brightest’ and most dynamic people come back to sub par opportunities, they’re gonna leave or break their bond ASAP. The yes men are predominantly the ones that stay in govt and rise up to become our future leaders and politicians. It’s very insular, and maybe this is why most new policies that come out of the government these days (especially related to job creation and upskilling) feels backward looking, behind the curve, and attempting to address problems from a highly detached position.\n\nAll I can say is, my exit interview will be glorious. Feel free to ask me anything, not like I’m doing anything important at work",

Not all, mind you, but it's quite a common complaint, and what I am guessing is that there is a disconnect between what you expect and what reality is.\n\nBecause you are a scholar, you likely expect to hit the ground running and given opportunities to show your capabilities. Good or bad, this isn't how public sector works. It is slow, methodical, by the books, and unlikely to challenge you the way you expect or desire to be challenged. \n\nThis was always going to be the gamble when taking up the offer, but this is no different from the private industry. If you get bonded, you have no idea if you're going to be in a place that's going to make good use of you and where you may learn something, or whether you get wasted and learn too little.\n\nYou're in year one.

The driver still fking go tug on the kids hand??? Tf????? \n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/share/v/1K1Gmp2Rrj/\n---\n\n“This morning I walked to the market to buy coriander to make bánh mì. Because I forgot to order coriander, I went to the market and then witnessed a traffic accident this morning in the car park of the Chinese temple near Maxwell MRT. This was the first time in my life that I witnessed a traffic accident happen right in front of me, at around 11:40 a.m. today.\n\nI was the first person walking behind a mother and her child. A woman was driving out from the car park and did not look to her right for pedestrians; she only looked to her left while turning right. Then the front wheel of her car ran over the little girl’s stomach, after that it ran over the mother’s leg, and then the woman suddenly stepped hard on the accelerator, causing the rear wheel to run over the mother’s stomach. I don’t know why she accelerated so quickly right after exiting the car park. I guess they’re tourists. I can help and might be the one to testify in the traffic accident.\n\nI saw very clearly that when the accident happened, the front wheel had already run over a person and the driver should have felt that there was something under the car, but she did not stop to get out and check. Instead, she accelerated strongly and continued driving, which caused the rear wheel to run over the mother’s stomach one more time. I panicked and cannot remember clearly whether the rear wheel ran over the little girl again — I really can’t remember because I was in shock from what happened in front of me.\n\nAt the time of the accident, the woman’s husband was not with her — only the mother and child were there, and I was walking behind them. About two minutes later, the husband ran over and held the little girl in his arms. When the front wheel ran over the little girl, she rolled three times and ended up lying face down on the ground, with her mouth bleeding heavily. The father used a water bottle and a camera to block the blood, but the blood from the child’s mouth flowed a lot and spread all over the road.\n\nWhen the woman got out of the car from the back to look, she then realized that she had caused the accident. She shouted loudly at the father who was holding his daughter, and she tried to explain that she was not at fault.”\n",

Though i have to admit by doing that, i sometimes came across as rude.   \nJust few days ago at Ya Kun Kaya Toast (Fortune Center) \n\nI was second in a queue of at least 8 pax, waiting for my turn.  \nI was one arm's length from the person in front.   \nThen a PRC woman stood just outside but between me and the person in front.   \nShe took out her phone and took a pic of the menu which was between me and the first in queue.   \nI had a feeling (likely stereotyped her) she was going to cut queue so i inched in closer to the person in front.  \nShe saw that and without facing me, she slid in between me and the person in front.   \nI kept quiet and waited to see if she would really make her order when it was her turn.   \nAnd just as she thought i let that slid, she opened her mouth to make her order to the cashier oblivious to the whole move, i raised my voice right at her face.   \n\"Eh, there is a queue here, dont cut queue\" in Mandarin.   \nShe turned to me and replied she didnt see and there is no need to raise my voice.   \nI replied louder in front of all the people in the place, \"U didnt see me, WTF!\" In English.   \nShe went quietly to the end of the queue. After I got my order, i deliberately walked to her.  \nBefore I can opened my mouth she shouted at me saying, \"U are of a low quality character to scold me like that\".   \nI replied in Mandarin, \"I have to do so with people of low quality like u\".   \nAnd i walked away. For that 20 secs or so while i walked away, she shouted at me scolding me.   \nHer voice literally pierced through the whole ground floor of the building.   \nI sashayed my ass slowly and quietly soaking in all the attention while making my exit.   \nStood up yes, let her screamed at me like a crazy uncivilised bitch. That was the icing for me. \n\n![gif](giphy|hVYVYZZBgF50k)",

      "selftext": "Hi, long time lurker first time poster, using a burner account. I’m in my mid 30s and after working for a little over a decade, I’ve managed to accumulate about SGD 2 mil in liquid assets (not including my house and CPF). The screenshot provides some proof (my equity account). I don’t have generational wealth, but I’m very financially secure. \n\nThis financial security has made my life much, much better. These are my 3 favourite things about getting rich. \n\n1. **I can prioritise life over work.** \n\nMy kids had a bout of illness recently and I took time off work to care for them. As I went through my calendar for the month, I realised that on average, I had worked four days or less each week. And more importantly, I was never stressed about what this might mean for my work or my performance.\n\nThis mindset and ability to let go are new to me. I’ve always put my best into school and work, and this paid off. I scored well, got a high paying job, and promoted fast. But as my salary grew so did my stress, my belly, and the number of friendships I lost. So over the past two years I’ve consciously traded work to reverse these trends and spend more time with my family.\n\nWork-life balance looks different for everyone. I like but I don’t love my work, so having the peace of mind from my finances to no longer feel a strong need to work has absolutely done wonders for me. My family, health, and social life have taken priority over my work, and I feel a lot happier most days. \n\n2. **I have a portfolio that lets me sleep well at night**\n\nSince this is r/singaporefi I guess I should share my current portfolio. It’s roughly: 65% equities (LSE ETFs), 30%  cash and bonds, and 5% gold. \n\nCan I optimize my portfolio? Definitely. Given my age I should allocate more to riskier assets, maybe even crypto. In fact, I got rich not just through high savings from a high paying job, but also because my old portfolio was almost 100% equities with many stock picks (big tech) that did very well. \n\nBut my old portfolio was too risky and I often lost sleep over it. No longer. After crossing the SGD 1.5 mil mark I rebalanced it slowly to where it is now and I have never lost any sleep over my portfolio since then. Yet the returns on my suboptimised portfolio last year covered my \n\nentire annual expense. \n\nAnd that’s one of the best things about being rich. I don’t need to take financial risks. I don’t need to chase high returns. I don’t need to care about vagaries of the market. I can just do whatever preserves my wealth and lets me sleep best at night.\n\n3. **I spend whatever I want on people and things that make my life better.**\n\nMy family and I went to MBS last year. When we arrived we realised that we had forgotten one of our kids’ shoes. Driving home or letting kiddo walk around barefooted weren’t options. So we just waltzed into one of the atas MBS kids shop and picked up a ridic overpriced pair of kids shoes. In our calculus, it was more than worth it to spend three digits to save the effort of carrying our chonky kid around the whole day. \n\nI can’t afford to buy a GCB or a sports car or fancy watches. But I can take grab everywhere, order ala carte at restaurants, and fly premium economy. I can splurge on experiences like holidays and musicals with my parents and wife and kids. I can throw money at problems and buy time and convenience. And to me, these things are the best uses of money, and one of the greatest perks of being rich. \n\n——\n\nTL;DR Life gets much better as you get rich, but only if you let it.\n\nGood luck everyone!

But once you defeat that temptation, that “in-game monster” is gonna drop $7 for you to collect.\n\n  \n\nOnly managing your finances at the end of the month when bills are due is gonna be hard if you don’t have stop gaps every 30 days of the month.\n\n  \n\nSo go forth and defeat your daily temptations: reserve 1 day a week to treat yourself to a casual meal. Negotiate downwards how many drinks you’re gonna have at a social event. \n\n  \n\nFinances is as much internal as it is tangible.\n\n  \n\nFrom somebody who lives paycheck to paycheck, I managed this month with money leftover on payday so I see this game as a success even though I’m only level 3.\n\n  \n\nAnother pro tip: those with high credit card balances - and find yourself with little to no cash after payday. Convert your balance to installments and stop using CC. Use cash and you can eat $5 cai png instead of having to charge food to your credit to survive. It’s cheaper in the long run and prevents snowball. ",

Second, inflation rate is not actually equal for everyone.\n\nFor the first point, you might need to relook at whether 1.3m in 2036 (11 years from now) is actually enough. For the second point, you will need to see what you are actually spending on.\n\nIf you envision owning a car, multiple properties and frequent visits to hospital, those are things that are inflating at a very high rate in Singapore. So, inflation rate will be high.\n\nIf you envision taking public transport, eating more hawker and having a relatively healthy life, inflation is not as high.\n\nAnother thing people ignore is CPF. CPF is a bond-like instrument. Whether you like it or not, 37% of your income goes there so remember to factor it in.\n\nAssuming you have hit FRS, all excess above FRS can be taken out from 55 onwards.\n\nThis means from 55 onwards, the interest from OA of 2.5% is perpetually available for you to take out and amount never goes down as long as you only take out the interest.\n\nFrom 65 onwards, CPF pays out around 6% of your RA annually. This means it is like a 6% perpetual bond (note it does eat into the RA amount but otherwise, it functions just like a perpetual bond).\n\nSo in reality, you don't actually need as much to retire, provided you are ok to see your cash-funded assets go down before 55 before being supplemented later by cashflow from CPF.\n\nIt does make calculations much more complicated but those are things that are usually ignored for a simpler 4%SWR.\n\nAlso, the 4% SWR is already inflation-adjusted. Some people miss this point and even the researcher who came up with it says that people can actually draw up to 4+% (can't remember exact % but I guess you already know this) because again, another point people ignore is that in retirement, you usually spend less. No more travels, no more funding of kids' education, no more mortgages, etc.\n\nThat said, the SWR is meant for a 30-year retirement based on the research. So nobody knows how it performs for longer period but in theory, you can just reduce the SWR for higher success or start with more.\n\nIn any case, it is always good to err on side of caution but do also note that there are many people who retire on less than this amount TODAY in Singapore, granted the lifestyle will not be a glamorous 1.\n\nI suggest you first calculate the present value of 1.3m in 2036 then see if it meets what you feel would be enough today.",

      "selftext": "So finally, the broken clock is right. \n\nWith the huge downswing that we have seen in US markets, let's pause, take a step back, and rewind how this sell-off unfolded. \n\nIt all started with the SAAS companies, a little over 2 weeks ago. We saw major names in the software sector getting hit with sharp corrections on fears that AI and Claude, specifically, could disrupt their subscription based business model. \n\nThen earlier this week, we saw reports of friction between OpenAI and Nvidia, sparking a correction for the semiconductor sector. This week, after major tech giants reported an unprecedented, hyper-aggressive rise in capex spending, the entire tech sector just sold down. \n\nValuations are the single most crucial thing in investinng. Buying a super high quality business at a gargantuan valuation makes it a bad decision automatically. And by now, I'm sure that everyone would be familiar with the fact that what goes up, must come down. \n\nTo address the common wisdom that it's impossible to time a crash, and hence continously buying into US tech despite skyhigh valuations is justified, let me pose a simple question to you. Are you sure that the risk to reward ratio is in your favour? How probable is it that when the market continues to go up and tanks eventually, it will still be higher than the current price that you are buying it? \n\nMe personally, seeing this volatility, well, I'll be lying if I said it didn't feel soooo good to prove the haters wrong. But am I going to liquidate my position in my dividend stocks in HK and go all in on us tech? No. I'm going to continue to remain rationale. Should the valuations of the companies continue to go down, I may even start a SMALL TINY position in solid, blue chip US tech companies. But as of right now, I'll still be patiently waiting on the sidelines. \n\nTo those that saw huge drawdowns in your portfolio this week, please take a moment to pen down your thoughts and emotions. It really helps to guard against FOMO and hype chasing, a few months later down the road. Valuable lessons can be learnt from this drawdown.\n\nTo end with a quote, \"The stock market functions as a mechanism that transfers wealth from the impatient to the patient\". ~ Warren Buffett. \n",

I’m thankful that I’ve not faced unemployment — I always had another offer lined up before tendering, typically taking a short 1–2 month break between roles, clearing my ALs for self love.\n\nOver the past few months though, I’ve been feeling increasingly drained and unmotivated, with a fair bit of anxiety whenever the next day is a working day. It feels like there’s no clear “end point” to corporate life, unlike schooling where timelines were always defined.\n\nLately, I’ve been seriously considering stepping away from the corporate world after a few more years, perhaps take on a few months OR a year or two of break. Thereafter, possibly to pursue something more flexible (“own time, own target” - unfortunately I don’t have a concrete plan yet). \n\nThe main reason for staying on a few more years in the corporate world would be to build a larger buffer and investment portfolio, ideally one that can cover a good portion (or all) of my monthly expenses via passive income. That way, I feel that I will be less anxious about leaving my job at that point of time.\n\nWould appreciate perspectives from those who’ve done something similar:\n\nBefore leaving, did you aim for a specific portfolio size or expense multiple for peace of mind?\n\nHow old were you when you made the move?\n\nDid you eventually return to a full-time corporate role, or transition into something else?\n\nSeeking advice and shared experiences only — not looking to be flamed. 🙏 Thanks in advance.",

I read thru every comment and think through it. Here are some answers that might make the picture clearer.\n\nMy life has changed against my will. Therefore here I am trying to rearrange my life after my soul mate of 25yrs suddenly departs from my life. \n\n*BTO:* \n\n* Have contacted HDB and they have exercise leniency in my case and allow me to keep the BTO. Application has also been changed to reflect my name only. \n* HPS does not work in this case because keys are yet to be collected. \n\n*Why take a loan for the BTO when I can fully paid it off?* \n\n* Original intention was to paid it off once we collect the keys so we don't have to worry about the other party financing the flat alone if one dies. \n* But situation changes now, his OA used +AI will now become cash proceeds when I sell instead of returning to his CPF-OA if he is still alive. I would rather keep the cash proceeds now and generate income from it while paying it slowly. If i happen to die with a loan, my beneficiary can just sell it off. \n\n*6K per month expenses &amp; travel expenses seems high*\n\n* I included cost of owning a car in the future (counting it as 2.5K in the expense for monthly repayments + vehicle expenses) into the predicted expenses. \n* Current expenses is less than 4K (including regularly investments and insurance), not counting one-time off stock purchases.  \n* Travel expenses and trips can always be adjusted, it just a wish to continue to what I used to do.\n\n*Liquid net* *worth, insurance payout, inheritance?*\n\n* No inheritance. Only a fully paid HDB, a fully paid car, CPF &amp; a business. \n* No insurance payout except DPS. He is not insurable, main reason why he wants me saves majority of my income for the future if he is gone. \n* Did not include valuables like gold, watches as I did not intend to sell unless I need the money for survival. (Est\\~300-350k after a haircut of 30% loss if I were to sell it)\n\n*Income:*\n\n* FT job \\~ 100K \n* Side hustle was approx \\~ 60-70K last year. But I project it be to 30K this year as I would just doing the minimum to keep myself relevant in the field.\n* Business \\~ it was my late husband business. Running a business that I am no prior experience in a lot of work and stress. But I would like to keep it going for as long as I can, no intention to just close or sell it even before I try, it was his effort and something he is passionate about but will let go once it becomes not profitable/sustainable. Income is just based of the salary I am current drawing, which is way below what he used to draw. Had to hire more help which thus increase in operating cost.  \n\n*Isn't there a income cap for bto buyers? How u get it in the first place?*\n\n* We applied it during covid years. I got no income from side hustle only FT job. His business was badly hit by covid for more than 2years. He did not draw any salary and sales drop 90%.  ",

Both of us are currently working full-time with unstable hours, frequent OT and occasional weekends. We’re staying with parents now but will be moving into our BTO soon, which is far from family support.\n\nDue to childcare constraints (often reaching home past 8pm), I’m considering stepping away from full-time work to be a SAHM after we move out. I’m conscious that this would likely be a one-way decision — I’m in tech and stepping away for several years would make returning extremely challenging.\n\nHusband’s role is more stable and it’s not ideal for him to quit, even though my income is currently higher.\n\nFinancials (Personal Assets):\n\n•\tTotal net worth: \\\\\\~550k\n\n•\tCPF: \\\\\\~230k (BTO payments not started yet)\n\n•\tInvestments: \\\\\\~170k\n\n•\t\\\\\\~60k US/tech stocks\n\n•\t\\\\\\~40k DBS shares\n\n•\tremainder in ILP\n\n•\tCash: \\\\\\~150k\n\nIncome (current):\n\n•\tMe: \\\\\\~110k p.a.\n\n•\tHusband: \\\\\\~80k p.a.\n\nWe’re expecting upcoming expenses for renovation, insurance, and higher household costs once we move out, so I’m cautious about liquidity.\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. Is it financially reasonable to rely on a single income (\\\\\\~80k p.a.) for household expenses in our situation?\n2. How much cash buffer would be prudent given BTO + reno in the near term?\n3. Any advice on managing investments/liquidity to support a single-income phase while preserving long-term financial flexibility?\n\nAppreciate any advice, especially from those who’ve gone through a single-income or SAHM phase.\n\nEdit:\n\nJust to clarify, the financials listed above are my personal assets, not combined household assets.\n\nI understand the feedback that relying on a single income may be challenging.

As I age, I am increasingly concerned that a road accident or health issue could lead to a disability that prevents me from working. My biggest fear is becoming a financial burden on my spouse.\n\n2. **Protecting the FIRE Timeline** I currently invest $4k–$5k/month to hit Barista FIRE by 45. If I lose my ability to earn, I don't just lose my lifestyle; I lose the ability to compound my investments. I want to \"insure\" my investment contributions so that my retirement goal remains on track even if I can't work.\n\nSpecific Questions for the Community\nHow much to insure? My current DII payout is only $1,200/month. Should I insure for my full income (~$10k/month), or just enough to cover expenses + my monthly investment target?\n\nHow long should the coverage last? Since my goal is Barista FIRE at 45, does it make sense to get a policy that covers me until:\n\nAge 45: The moment I \"retire,\" and cancel my plan\n\nAge 55: When I can withdraw CPF OA/SA\n\nAge 65: When CPF LIFE payouts begin",

If you worry about the increased risk events (I.e. riding bike), you can increase the personal accident sum assured. I think your dilemma more into what's enough for your wife especially facing long term disability.\n\nPersonally, here's my thought process:\nTerm life/TPD insurance sum assured: I covered till 65 only and I don’t have dependent when my kid grow up. Sum assured is based on 15 years of expenses. Post that will be covered by the investment portfolio if live longer.\n\nCritical illness: I covered only 6 years of expenses as I do some research and majority late stage illness can live only 3-5 years. If unfortunate to encounter early CI I checked with insurance agent the cost is about 100k, then i just have to pay from the emergency cash/investments portfolio as the cost of ECI and benefit is not justified. \n\nYou can consider the short term disability income insurance covered till 45 or 50 whichever you deem is the critical period in the event doc certify you are unable to work for regardless of illness/accident.\n\nThe long term care insurance is underrated though we have careshield life. Given that both you and wife dont intend to have kid, you might need to think who going to take care of you if face long term care? Hence, I buy the enhanced careshield life fully pay by CPF.\n\nMy thought about insurance is I wouldn't know how much is enough, but I will buy some to cushion the impact and the rest to be covered by investment portfolio.\n\nIf you care so much about the loved one, remember to do the Last Power of Attorney (it's free till March this year), do the nomination for CPF and insurance, and lastly the will. This will minimise the hurdle to be faced by your loved one.",

Then cover the credit line once the VOO sale settles. You’ll be paying a little bit of interest for the 1-2 days of credit line use, but it’s much better for me to hedge against market moves during those 1-2 days of settlement gap.\n\nOf course if VOO is the only thing you hold, you won’t be able to sell it all at once and then buy all at once since your credit line won’t be enough to cover the full amount.\n\nWhat you can do is to do it in batches, sell 1/5 of VOO, buy 1/5 of CSPX. Then repeat till all batches complete. You don’t care about doing it over time since you’re swapping 2 of the same things so doing it over time is fine.\n\nIn fact I used this method to swap IWDA for VWRA recently… I wanted to sell IWDA and buy VWRA, but didn’t want to have a gap of being out of the market. This allows me to do the swap pretty much immediately.",
