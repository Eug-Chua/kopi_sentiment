While walking through the car park near the Chinese temple at Maxwell MRT, I witnessed a traffic accident at around 11:40 a.m. today. It was the first time in my life that I saw a traffic accident happen right in front of me.\n\n&gt;I was the first person walking behind the mother and her daughter. A woman was driving out from the car park. She did not look to the right for pedestrians; she only looked to the left when she turned right. The front wheel of her car ran over the little girl’s abdomen first, then over the mother’s leg. After that, the woman pressed the accelerator hard, and the rear wheel ran over the mother’s abdomen again.\n\n&gt;I don’t know why she accelerated so quickly when she just exited the car park. I guess they might be tourists. I can help as a witness and testify about this traffic accident.\n\n&gt;I clearly saw that when the front wheel ran over them, the driver should have felt that there was something under the wheel. However, she did not stop to get out of the car to check. Instead, she accelerated strongly and continued to drive forward, which caused the rear wheel to run over the mother’s abdomen again.\n\n&gt;I panicked at that moment and cannot remember clearly whether the rear wheel ran over the little girl again. I was in shock when the incident happened right in front of me.\n\n&gt;At the time of the accident, the husband was not with them. Only the mother and daughter were there, and I was walking behind them. About two minutes later, the husband ran over and hugged the little girl.\n\n&gt;When the front wheel ran over the little girl, she was thrown and rolled about three times and ended up lying face down on the ground. Her mouth was in a pool of blood, next to her water bottle and her camera. The blood was flowing heavily from her mouth and spread thickly on the road.\n\n&gt;When the woman got out of the car and went to the back to check, she then realized that she had caused the accident.

Unless something is done to address it, people will continue to think that cars are better (because they are).\n\nThen, people will get angry as public transport quality declines.\n\nAs of now, the main reason stopping people from far flung areas switching to cars is the high cost, not because it is not logical (it is in fact very logical for you to want to switch, if you can afford it).\n\nThat and people living further out tend to be less wealthy.\n\nIn other countries and cities, jams and heavy traffic forces the car option to be equally shit, so there is no “alternative”, whether you can pay your way out or not.\n\nHere, people are priced out by design. Urban planning and car policies forces non-wealthy citizens into public transport and remove alternatives.\n\nThe barrier is not because people like public transport! It is because although someone can take 1/3 the time of their usual (peak) commute to travel by say taxi, it is financially unfeasible because it costs almost $100 a day to do so for some areas.\n\nThe layout of our country forces poor people to the far out area, concentrating the relatively wealthy people around the central core.\n\nThis made it seems like we are controlling car usage by forcefully locking in people who are more likely to switch away from public transport by pricing them out out private transport.\n\nThen, the wealthy people who do drive have less incentives to switch from cars, because they are not going to switch to the public transport option anyway even if it is competitive. Their trade off was never really about commute time, so how can you incentivise them out of cars even if you built a MRT station in their front porch?\n\nThen, the non-wealthy people who still overcame high cost to buy cars will try to maximise their value, so they will keep using and get pissed if the value of using cars is infringed.\n\nPrice them out, they get angry because the alternative really sucks and you are forcing them out without giving them a fair alternative. To cater to them, the alternatives need to be good (as direct and point-to-point, which runs counter to LTA’s hub-and-spoke approach).\n\nIn the end, trying to incentivise “car-lite” is doomed. For car-lite policies to work, people need to have cars vs public transport as their core question. But this seems to be not the case!\n\nAs I said, people who uses public transport are forced to. A large segment who do not does so by choice and could afford it. A smaller segment can be coaxed out but the way to do it contradict current policy directions.\n\nSo where is the large segment that policies can work on and incentivise change? If they do not exist, then how can existing policies work?\n\nUnless LTA abandon efficiency-maximisation and allow more point-to-point (direct) options in public transport, car will be king and users will still fight tooth and nail against public transport.\n\nExpress trains and buses are probably some of the things that are needed to coax the car users who could be coaxed.\n\nI am sure users are willing to pay more to a degree for more direct public transport options. And by direct I do not mean the current express bus system. Those sucks because of lengthy non-express sectors and limited routes/timing, which means you are often just paying with money and time for a seat, if it is even an option for you.",

But public transport is not there yet. It is better than most countries but still not good enough. Due to the last mile and other transition factors.\n\nI wrote to LTA to suggest some options for a bus service. You see my work place is like 5 mins away (by car, about &lt;5km away and about &lt;3km from the interchange) but I need to take 3 buses to get to work (1 to interchange, then 1 from interchange to 2 bus-stops away, then the last bus is another 2 bus stops after that). I researched the route and discovered that there 5 buses from the interchange heading so close to the bus stop i need to alight at, but all turn off (1 bus stops before) reaching my destination. Note that 5 bus stops in total are all quite far apart as there are along the PIE. \n\nI asked LTA to consider having a direct bus to my work location bus stop from the interchange as based on observations, hundreds take the same route as myself every morning. I see the same faces at the interchange. LTA said no.\n\nI understand that the MRT can't cover every gap, but at least buses can. Then to my horror, I discovered I do have a direct bus from my home bus stop to my work location. But you know what? Before it reaches my work bus stop, it goes on express not stopping at my work bus stop. Wow, amazing, striking 4D would be easier. \n\nLooks like I will eventually need to drive to work which is such a waste as the distance is so near. Taking the bus is hectic (For a 60+ year old) as the last bus is always crowded and it often is late due to jams on the PIE. Going home is no ride in the park as well and it gets worst when it rains.

Our deepest condolences to the family and hope justice will be served. \n\nMy question is , if we happened to witness an accident , and the victims are injured, how can we render help to them before the paramedics arrive? \nAre there things we can do to help with the situation instead of being bystanders ? \n\nCuz i saw the video of that accident and alot people were just standing around observing what was happening untill the paramedics arrived , so how can we help out in the situation by any way before the ambulance/paramedics arrive ??\n \n\n\nEdit ;\n\n\nConsolidation of points : \n\n1. Call 995 ( inform the exact location and number of victims , if they are stuck in a car etc).\n\n2. Dont move victim\n\n3. Use Umbrella to help shade Victims from Sun/Rain \n\n4. Call out for anyone who has first aid /BCLS training / find the nearest AED ( check locations on myresponder app ) \n\n5. Ensure the victim is conscious/has a heart beat if not administer CPR \n\n6.  Help to clear/redirect traffic if its not on a highway.. \n\n7. Help with crowd control/clearing the crowd\n\n8. If there's a GP clinic nearby , run and get a doctor to help. \n\n9.  Take note of what happened, time of accident etc so you can explain to the paramedics /SPF when they arrive..(for investigation purposes)\n- videos , pictures, type down in your phone.\n\n\n",

I was walking about 10 feet behind behind this girl (maybe around 8-10 years old), who was holding hands with a grandmother. On the other side of the grandmother, there was also a boy who I assume is her brother (maybe around 10-12 years old). All of a sudden, this extremely angry woman (who I assume is their mother) stormed towards them while screaming at the top of her lungs, and when she got close to the girl, she started hitting the girl very hard while continuously yelling at the girl and the grandmother. She slapped the girl's face very hard twice and also hit her on the back while berating her in front of everyone. I also saw the mom drag her daughter by some body part, but for the life of me, l cannot remember if it was her hair or cheek or ear or something else... I think I was so traumatized by what I saw that I blocked this detail out of my memory... The mom was yelling in Mandarin, and my Mandarin is not that good, so l have no idea why this was happening.\n\nThere were a lot of people walking by, and many people were surprised by the commotion, but scurried away without confronting them. The mom, girl, grandmother, and boy walked off quickly as the mom was rushing them away while continuing to yell at them very loudly. As they walked away, I paused and stood there in shock. I'm still thinking about it a few days later, and I'm now wondering if I should have said or done something to intervene at the moment. Again, there was a language barrier here, so l have no idea what she was so upset about, but nothing, absolutely nothing can justify slapping a child across the face so hard and hitting a child in anger like that. Should I have reported it to the police on the spot? Is it too late to make an online report to the National Anti-Violence Helpline? Am I overreacting cuz I'm not from Singapore?",

Over the last two years, I had already been traveling frequently—about 40 days per year—under my previous company’s work-from-anywhere (WFA) policy, which allowed me to test different locations across Southeast Asia. So far, I’ve spent time in various parts of Thailand, Vietnam, and most recently Cambodia.\n\nAfter being retrenched last year, I started working on my own startup, which currently earns around SGD 3,000 per month. In many Southeast Asian countries, that income allows for a relatively comfortable lifestyle.\n\nI am currently based in Cambodia and have been living here for about two months. Although Cambodia sometimes has a negative reputation due to scams or safety concerns, I’ve personally found the quality of life here to be quite decent—especially compared to Singapore. The visa process is also significantly easier than in countries like Thailand or Vietnam.\n\nIn Phnom Penh, a one-bedroom apartment with a pool and gym typically costs around SGD 700 per month, excluding utilities. Food expenses average about SGD 20–30 per day if I dine at cafés or restaurants, and can drop to around SGD 10 per day if I eat local meals.\n\nOverall, my monthly expenses are usually around SGD 2,000 if I live normally, and could be optimized further by shopping more locally. Recently, my spending went above SGD 3,000 because I’ve been exploring—visiting places like Siem Reap and Kampot, and occasionally enjoying nightlife. I’ve intentionally given myself about a year of financial runway to experiment with this lifestyle.\n\nLike you, I don’t prioritize material comfort as much as experiences. I enjoy exploring new places, nature, cafés, beaches, and different cultures. I’m also currently learning how to ride a motorbike so I can explore more independently.\n\nMy favorite places so far have been Koh Samui in Thailand and Da Nang in Vietnam. Next, I’m planning to explore Cebu City for its beaches and nightlife.\n\nUltimately, the decision is very personal. There are many countries where you can live affordably due to currency differences. I highly recommend doing a trial stay before committing long-term—living somewhere as a tourist is very different from actually living there day-to-day.\n\nHope this helps, and I’m happy to chat with anyone who’s interested in exploring this path.\n\n",

Pay cut is not everything because you move back with international working experience which can be very valuable. \n\nLanguage wise there are not many English speaking jobs around but my role was lucky enough to be able to work in completely English (but in the end I picked up French anyway it helps massively at work lol). I would also say straight up that B1 is not enough, B2 gives you a bit of chance but for foreigners you’d need at least C1 to have a strong chance. \n\nBeyond language you also need a recognised degree because France does not recognise all university certificates+ they are minimum masters only. \n\nFriendships are not easy to come by and if you don’t speak the language you might end up only hanging out with other foreigners/expats.

The societal system in India allows the upper caste to get away with all kinds of crimes. Now, when a pro-CECA government like PAP shields these people, it further amplifies their ego that they are sovereign and above the law. Previous Ceca cases such as Ramesh Erramalli who worked in JP Morgan with a fake degree, has shown the other Cecas in Singapore that they can abuse people and get away with it. Hence, I have absolutely no faith in the justice system that this Ceca driver would get the appropriate punishments.\n\nOn my part, I don't support any pro-CECA party otherwise I won't be able to sleep at night, the PAP MPs who knock on my door every GE knows that I only have one request, that's to abolish CECA for the collective benefit of Singaporeans, I told them not to bother speaking to me until CECA is abolished, then overtime the door knock stops, because they know this request is impossible to fulfill as it's their fundamental core policy which is existential to their political survival.",

While walking through the car park near the Chinese temple at Maxwell MRT, I witnessed a traffic accident at around 11:40 a.m. today. It was the first time in my life that I saw a traffic accident happen right in front of me.\n\nI was the first person walking behind the mother and her daughter. A woman was driving out from the car park. She did not look to the right for pedestrians; she only looked to the left when she turned right. The front wheel of her car ran over the little girl’s abdomen first, then over the mother’s leg. After that, the woman pressed the accelerator hard, and the rear wheel ran over the mother’s abdomen again.\n\nI don’t know why she accelerated so quickly when she just exited the car park. I guess they might be tourists. I can help as a witness and testify about this traffic accident.\n\nI clearly saw that when the front wheel ran over them, the driver should have felt that there was something under the wheel. However, she did not stop to get out of the car to check. Instead, she accelerated strongly and continued to drive forward, which caused the rear wheel to run over the mother’s abdomen again.\n\nI panicked at that moment and cannot remember clearly whether the rear wheel ran over the little girl again. I was in shock when the incident happened right in front of me.\n\nAt the time of the accident, the husband was not with them. Only the mother and daughter were there, and I was walking behind them. About two minutes later, the husband ran over and hugged the little girl.\n\nWhen the front wheel ran over the little girl, she was thrown and rolled about three times and ended up lying face down on the ground. Her mouth was in a pool of blood, next to her water bottle and her camera. The blood was flowing heavily from her mouth and spread thickly on the road.\n\nWhen the woman got out of the car and went to the back to check, she then realized that she had caused the accident. She raised her voice at the father while their daughter was injured and kept trying to explain that she was not at fault.",

The driver still fking go tug on the kids hand??? Tf????? \n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/share/v/1K1Gmp2Rrj/\n---\n\n“This morning I walked to the market to buy coriander to make bánh mì. Because I forgot to order coriander, I went to the market and then witnessed a traffic accident this morning in the car park of the Chinese temple near Maxwell MRT. This was the first time in my life that I witnessed a traffic accident happen right in front of me, at around 11:40 a.m. today.\n\nI was the first person walking behind a mother and her child. A woman was driving out from the car park and did not look to her right for pedestrians; she only looked to her left while turning right. Then the front wheel of her car ran over the little girl’s stomach, after that it ran over the mother’s leg, and then the woman suddenly stepped hard on the accelerator, causing the rear wheel to run over the mother’s stomach. I don’t know why she accelerated so quickly right after exiting the car park. I guess they’re tourists. I can help and might be the one to testify in the traffic accident.\n\nI saw very clearly that when the accident happened, the front wheel had already run over a person and the driver should have felt that there was something under the car, but she did not stop to get out and check. Instead, she accelerated strongly and continued driving, which caused the rear wheel to run over the mother’s stomach one more time. I panicked and cannot remember clearly whether the rear wheel ran over the little girl again — I really can’t remember because I was in shock from what happened in front of me.\n\nAt the time of the accident, the woman’s husband was not with her — only the mother and child were there, and I was walking behind them. About two minutes later, the husband ran over and held the little girl in his arms. When the front wheel ran over the little girl, she rolled three times and ended up lying face down on the ground, with her mouth bleeding heavily. The father used a water bottle and a camera to block the blood, but the blood from the child’s mouth flowed a lot and spread all over the road.\n\nWhen the woman got out of the car from the back to look, she then realized that she had caused the accident. She shouted loudly at the father who was holding his daughter, and she tried to explain that she was not at fault.”\n",

For that 20 secs or so while i walked away, she shouted at me scolding me.   \nHer voice literally pierced through the whole ground floor of the building.   \nI sashayed my ass slowly and quietly soaking in all the attention while making my exit.   \nStood up yes, let her screamed at me like a crazy uncivilised bitch.

These names are based on hard to compile sources (word of mouth, forums, Telegram, Lemon8, etc). The aim is to share information so that others can do their own due diligence before committing. Along with the names, I'll try my best to include links to where the discussions took place so you can verify yourself. These are rarely available depending on where it was sourced from.\n\nNote: some of these experiences were with certain individual IDs within these firms, so you may still have a good experience if you engage the right person. There’s also the possibility that IDs move between firms, so please always do your own diligence. However, if you’ve had experiences where the workmanship itself was poor, do mention it - as that usually points to the contractors used by the firm as a whole, not just the individual ID.\n\nIf you are an ID/contractor reading this, please note this list reflects individual experiences and feedback - not absolute fact - and I encourage homeowners to always research further.\n\nHere’s the current list (please add on if you’ve come across others or PM me directly):\n\n1.

That way homeowners can better assess (since it’s very probable that reviews of the mothership would apply to the subsidiary/split firm). Also note that even though this post has been made some time ago, I update it frequently whenever I find more or ppl reach out.",

      "selftext": "Hi, long time lurker first time poster, using a burner account. I’m in my mid 30s and after working for a little over a decade, I’ve managed to accumulate about SGD 2 mil in liquid assets (not including my house and CPF). The screenshot provides some proof (my equity account). I don’t have generational wealth, but I’m very financially secure. \n\nThis financial security has made my life much, much better. These are my 3 favourite things about getting rich. \n\n1. **I can prioritise life over work.** \n\nMy kids had a bout of illness recently and I took time off work to care for them. As I went through my calendar for the month, I realised that on average, I had worked four days or less each week. And more importantly, I was never stressed about what this might mean for my work or my performance.\n\nThis mindset and ability to let go are new to me. I’ve always put my best into school and work, and this paid off. I scored well, got a high paying job, and promoted fast. But as my salary grew so did my stress, my belly, and the number of friendships I lost. So over the past two years I’ve consciously traded work to reverse these trends and spend more time with my family.\n\nWork-life balance looks different for everyone. I like but I don’t love my work, so having the peace of mind from my finances to no longer feel a strong need to work has absolutely done wonders for me. My family, health, and social life have taken priority over my work, and I feel a lot happier most days. \n\n2. **I have a portfolio that lets me sleep well at night**\n\nSince this is r/singaporefi I guess I should share my current portfolio. It’s roughly: 65% equities (LSE ETFs), 30%  cash and bonds, and 5% gold. \n\nCan I optimize my portfolio? Definitely. Given my age I should allocate more to riskier assets, maybe even crypto. In fact, I got rich not just through high savings from a high paying job, but also because my old portfolio was almost 100% equities with many stock picks (big tech) that did very well. \n\nBut my old portfolio was too risky and I often lost sleep over it. No longer. After crossing the SGD 1.5 mil mark I rebalanced it slowly to where it is now and I have never lost any sleep over my portfolio since then. Yet the returns on my suboptimised portfolio last year covered my \n\nentire annual expense. \n\nAnd that’s one of the best things about being rich. I don’t need to take financial risks. I don’t need to chase high returns. I don’t need to care about vagaries of the market. I can just do whatever preserves my wealth and lets me sleep best at night.\n\n3. **I spend whatever I want on people and things that make my life better.**\n\nMy family and I went to MBS last year. When we arrived we realised that we had forgotten one of our kids’ shoes. Driving home or letting kiddo walk around barefooted weren’t options. So we just waltzed into one of the atas MBS kids shop and picked up a ridic overpriced pair of kids shoes. In our calculus, it was more than worth it to spend three digits to save the effort of carrying our chonky kid around the whole day. \n\nI can’t afford to buy a GCB or a sports car or fancy watches. But I can take grab everywhere, order ala carte at restaurants, and fly premium economy. I can splurge on experiences like holidays and musicals with my parents and wife and kids. I can throw money at problems and buy time and convenience. And to me, these things are the best uses of money, and one of the greatest perks of being rich. \n\n——\n\nTL;DR Life gets much better as you get rich, but only if you let it.\n\nGood luck everyone!

We saw major names in the software sector getting hit with sharp corrections on fears that AI and Claude, specifically, could disrupt their subscription based business model. \n\nThen earlier this week, we saw reports of friction between OpenAI and Nvidia, sparking a correction for the semiconductor sector. This week, after major tech giants reported an unprecedented, hyper-aggressive rise in capex spending, the entire tech sector just sold down. \n\nValuations are the single most crucial thing in investinng.

And by now, I'm sure that everyone would be familiar with the fact that what goes up, must come down. \n\nTo address the common wisdom that it's impossible to time a crash, and hence continously buying into US tech despite skyhigh valuations is justified, let me pose a simple question to you. Are you sure that the risk to reward ratio is in your favour? How probable is it that when the market continues to go up and tanks eventually, it will still be higher than the current price that you are buying it? \n\nMe personally, seeing this volatility, well, I'll be lying if I said it didn't feel soooo good to prove the haters wrong. But am I going to liquidate my position in my dividend stocks in HK and go all in on us tech? No. I'm going to continue to remain rationale. Should the valuations of the companies continue to go down, I may even start a SMALL TINY position in solid, blue chip US tech companies. But as of right now, I'll still be patiently waiting on the sidelines. \n\nTo those that saw huge drawdowns in your portfolio this week, please take a moment to pen down your thoughts and emotions. It really helps to guard against FOMO and hype chasing, a few months later down the road. Valuable lessons can be learnt from this drawdown.\n\nTo end with a quote, \"The stock market functions as a mechanism that transfers wealth from the impatient to the patient\". ~ Warren Buffett. \n",

Most of the time promotion means moving into supervisory role. That means from individual contributor (IC) to management. That can give a big pay jump. BUT...\n\nThe thing that makes one a good IC is not what will make one a good manager. As a manager you have to learn people skills, you have to discipline/counsel poor performers, manage talents who are smarter than you, learn delegation skills, learn how to present to board meetings, deal with politics like other managers who bully your staff. You may have to work on strategy and plans, like thinking what the company should do in 5 years time. Etc etc.\n\nEventually you find that your specialisation (whatever you did as IC) becomes less and less.\n\nIf you want to remain as individual contributor, then your growth is limited.

Then cover the credit line once the VOO sale settles. You’ll be paying a little bit of interest for the 1-2 days of credit line use, but it’s much better for me to hedge against market moves during those 1-2 days of settlement gap.\n\nOf course if VOO is the only thing you hold, you won’t be able to sell it all at once and then buy all at once since your credit line won’t be enough to cover the full amount.\n\nWhat you can do is to do it in batches, sell 1/5 of VOO, buy 1/5 of CSPX. Then repeat till all batches complete. You don’t care about doing it over time since you’re swapping 2 of the same things so doing it over time is fine.\n\nIn fact I used this method to swap IWDA for VWRA recently… I wanted to sell IWDA and buy VWRA, but didn’t want to have a gap of being out of the market.
