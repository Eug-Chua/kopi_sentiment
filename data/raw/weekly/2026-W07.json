While walking through the car park near the Chinese temple at Maxwell MRT, I witnessed a traffic accident at around 11:40 a.m. today. It was the first time in my life that I saw a traffic accident happen right in front of me.\n\n&gt;I was the first person walking behind the mother and her daughter. A woman was driving out from the car park. She did not look to the right for pedestrians; she only looked to the left when she turned right. The front wheel of her car ran over the little girl’s abdomen first, then over the mother’s leg. After that, the woman pressed the accelerator hard, and the rear wheel ran over the mother’s abdomen again.\n\n&gt;I don’t know why she accelerated so quickly when she just exited the car park. I guess they might be tourists. I can help as a witness and testify about this traffic accident.\n\n&gt;I clearly saw that when the front wheel ran over them, the driver should have felt that there was something under the wheel. However, she did not stop to get out of the car to check. Instead, she accelerated strongly and continued to drive forward, which caused the rear wheel to run over the mother’s abdomen again.\n\n&gt;I panicked at that moment and cannot remember clearly whether the rear wheel ran over the little girl again. I was in shock when the incident happened right in front of me.\n\n&gt;At the time of the accident, the husband was not with them. Only the mother and daughter were there, and I was walking behind them. About two minutes later, the husband ran over and hugged the little girl.\n\n&gt;When the front wheel ran over the little girl, she was thrown and rolled about three times and ended up lying face down on the ground. Her mouth was in a pool of blood, next to her water bottle and her camera. The blood was flowing heavily from her mouth and spread thickly on the road.\n\n&gt;When the woman got out of the car and went to the back to check, she then realized that she had caused the accident. She raised her voice at the father while their daughter was injured and kept trying to explain that she was not at fault.",

      "selftext": "TLDR: Very poor management by the parties involved, Scoot and the Airport, from scheduled takeoff to actual arrival took 12hours+\nsome ppl (including elderlies and ppl on crutches) only received food 9 hours later and went without sleep throughout the entire ordeal, did not receive on ground transport and hotel contrary to Scoot's statement. \n\n\nI was unfortunately on flight TR 497 from KL to SG which Scoot said: \"affected customers were provided with accommodation, refreshments and on-ground transport.\" Over here https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/scoot-flight-from-kuala-lumpur-on-feb-9-cancelled-after-technical-fault-detected\n\n\nSurprised to read about the Refreshment and passengers being sent to hotel to rest, as quite a few of us had a totally different experience, went about 9 hours without food or rest.\n\nTill today, we have not heard directly from Scoot (although we booked through trip.com who reached out to us so wondering if Scoot only communicated with passengers who booked directly).\n\nWhile I can understand the technical issues was unexpected, Scoot's handling of the cancellation was extremely disappointing, there was lack of communication, clarity and proper process. \n\nWe only managed to get our boarding pass about 9 hours later, after much detours and abrupt changes, without sleep or food (even though Scoot mentioned providing Refreshments, it seemed like most passengers did not received it). Only arrived back in Singapore at around 12pm the following day, which meant the need to apply for leave from work.\n\nNevertheless, it was an interesting experience, we quickly became friends with strangers, including an elderly Korean lady who was travelling alone and anxious. When we finally boarded the next flight back 12 hours later, we saw many fellow passengers  who bonded and helped each other through the arduous 12 hours, taking pictures and biding farewell even though they did not speak the same language.\n\n\n-Sat on the runway for about an hour before the crew finally informed us of the issue\n\n-Only offered plain water at 12am. When we requested for snacks, after a 2 hours delay into a supposedly 1 hour flight, the crew informed us we had to purchase in flight meals\n\n-There was another airplane stuck behind us for about 3 hours since our flight was blocking access to the takeoff runway, it was eventually towed away\n\n-Could feel the Captain was empathetic which is appreciated, however, there were multiple occasions when they didnt update us for up to an hour even though they announced they would in 20 mins etc\n\n-Once we arrived back at the terminal, the nightmare continued, total chaos and lack of clarity + communication \n\n-There was a long queue to enter the only lift which would bring us inside  the airport, once we exited the lift we were told to head to counter P9\n\n-After queuing for a long time to enter P9, the other passengers in front of us suddenly turned around and walked towards the opposite direction, the staff did not communicate anything, we only found out through word of mouth from other passengers that P9 was for passengers who would like to cancel and get a refund.\n\n-It seemed like Refreshments were being distributed at P9 so we ended up with zero Refreshment as we had to follow the queue of ppl walking in the opposite direction if we're would like to take the next earliest flight by SIA.\n\n-Again, through word of mouth, at around 2 or 3 am, we were told that we would be heading to sunway pyramid hotel which was about an hour away, this created a lot of unrest among the weary passengers (many haven't eaten or rest since 10pm). It didnt make sense to travel to the hotel, spend proably an hour or two, or maybe even lesser accounting for potential traffic jam,  waiting time to check in hundreds of passengers,before travelling another hour back to the airport as we heard the earliest flight was around 9/10am (checked with the staff if we could opt for a later flight to get some rest if we were to go to the hotel but they seemed as lost as we were). At this point there was a queue of a few hundred passengers waiting to exit the immigration which would take some time too\n\n-When we finally exited immigration, a lot of us lost sight of the staff and did not know where to board the bus to the hotel, some passengers who did not speak English were very anxious\n\n-We ended up making friends with other passengers to share info and figure things out, \"adopting\" an elderly Korean who was travelling alone and spoke no English as she looked anxious\n\n-since we lost sight of the staff, about a hundred of us gathered at Scoot's terminal, which was unfortunately not opened yet\n\n-after some time a staff finally came to Scott's counter and told us to follow her to board the bus to the hotel\n\n-while waiting (what seems like an hour) for the bus,  at about 5am the staff told us we will not be travelling to the hotel anymore,  but head to the next terminal to board the 10am flight to Singapore\n\n-the airport shuttle bus which is used by the public to the terminal was full which led to even more waiting\n\n-once we boarded the bus, we were surprised to see the staff not onboard,  we were expected to make our own way, some passengers alighted at the wrong stop and we had to help inform them\n\n-finally reached SIA terminal at about 6am and got our boarding pass, close to 9 hours since the scheduled takeoff and about 6 hours since we disembarked from the plane\n\n-the staff at the counter seemed unaware about the flight cancellation and was surprised to hear our flight was supposed to take off 10 hours ago\n\n-we were finally issued 35RM meal voucher, proceed to have our first meal in 10 hours with our newfound friends and the elderly Korean passenger\n\n-quite a few of us had difficulty entering the departure hall as the Malaysian immigration doesn't seem to be aware of the flight cancellation, some ended up spending more than an hour after being sent on a wild goose chase by the immigration officers who did not knew how to handle passengers from the cancelled flight\n\nOverall a very tiring but interesting experience\n\n\nEdit\n1. We didnt really had time to get food as the staff told us to follow them, from the moment we dismebarked to the moment we were reissued a new boarding pass, it was endless waiting and queueing at immigration, bus stop etc as you can read from above. If u wandered off the get food you might get left behind. It would have been a different story if there was clear communication as to where to reschedule our flights as opposed to asking a few hundred ppl to follow them without much info.\n\n2. The point of this post is to highlight how the process was extremely disorganised and disappointing. Funny to see some snarky and strange comments focusing on 3rd party booking lol. From what we saw, Passengers who booked direct + 3rd party went through the same process and got the same treatment. They were so disorganised I doubt they even knew who booked direct and who booked through 3rd party.\n\n3. I am not sure how flight cancellation is typically handled, but yes it seems like it wasn't solely Scoot which mismanaged. We suspect tue staff who spoke to us were from KLIA, so we proably had zero contact with anyone from Scoot.\n\n4. While it was an incredibly fustrating and anxious experience, a minor few were condescending in their interaction with the staff, which was pretty ugly. At the end of the day, everyone is just trying their best, the staff looked as lost as we were, they dont make the SOPs and seemed to be poorly trained, which isnt their fault. They are just junior employees who probably have zero decision making powers, not right to act out on them.\n\n5.  Most ppl were kind and helpful; kindness cuts across language barriers and nationality, strangers turned into friends who looked out for one another since we had no one else to rely upon.",

Unless something is done to address it, people will continue to think that cars are better (because they are).\n\nThen, people will get angry as public transport quality declines.\n\nAs of now, the main reason stopping people from far flung areas switching to cars is the high cost, not because it is not logical (it is in fact very logical for you to want to switch, if you can afford it).\n\nThat and people living further out tend to be less wealthy.\n\nIn other countries and cities, jams and heavy traffic forces the car option to be equally shit, so there is no “alternative”, whether you can pay your way out or not.\n\nHere, people are priced out by design. Urban planning and car policies forces non-wealthy citizens into public transport and remove alternatives.\n\nThe barrier is not because people like public transport! It is because although someone can take 1/3 the time of their usual (peak) commute to travel by say taxi, it is financially unfeasible because it costs almost $100 a day to do so for some areas.\n\nThe layout of our country forces poor people to the far out area, concentrating the relatively wealthy people around the central core.\n\nThis made it seems like we are controlling car usage by forcefully locking in people who are more likely to switch away from public transport by pricing them out out private transport.\n\nThen, the wealthy people who do drive have less incentives to switch from cars, because they are not going to switch to the public transport option anyway even if it is competitive. Their trade off was never really about commute time, so how can you incentivise them out of cars even if you built a MRT station in their front porch?\n\nThen, the non-wealthy people who still overcame high cost to buy cars will try to maximise their value, so they will keep using and get pissed if the value of using cars is infringed.\n\nPrice them out, they get angry because the alternative really sucks and you are forcing them out without giving them a fair alternative. To cater to them, the alternatives need to be good (as direct and point-to-point, which runs counter to LTA’s hub-and-spoke approach).\n\nIn the end, trying to incentivise “car-lite” is doomed. For car-lite policies to work, people need to have cars vs public transport as their core question. But this seems to be not the case!\n\nAs I said, people who uses public transport are forced to. A large segment who do not does so by choice and could afford it. A smaller segment can be coaxed out but the way to do it contradict current policy directions.\n\nSo where is the large segment that policies can work on and incentivise change? If they do not exist, then how can existing policies work?\n\nUnless LTA abandon efficiency-maximisation and allow more point-to-point (direct) options in public transport, car will be king and users will still fight tooth and nail against public transport.\n\nExpress trains and buses are probably some of the things that are needed to coax the car users who could be coaxed.\n\nI am sure users are willing to pay more to a degree for more direct public transport options. And by direct I do not mean the current express bus system. Those sucks because of lengthy non-express sectors and limited routes/timing, which means you are often just paying with money and time for a seat, if it is even an option for you.",

You see my work place is like 5 mins away (by car, about &lt;5km away and about &lt;3km from the interchange) but I need to take 3 buses to get to work (1 to interchange, then 1 from interchange to 2 bus-stops away, then the last bus is another 2 bus stops after that). I researched the route and discovered that there 5 buses from the interchange heading so close to the bus stop i need to alight at, but all turn off (1 bus stops before) reaching my destination. Note that 5 bus stops in total are all quite far apart as there are along the PIE. \n\nI asked LTA to consider having a direct bus to my work location bus stop from the interchange as based on observations, hundreds take the same route as myself every morning. I see the same faces at the interchange. LTA said no.\n\nI understand that the MRT can't cover every gap, but at least buses can. Then to my horror, I discovered I do have a direct bus from my home bus stop to my work location. But you know what? Before it reaches my work bus stop, it goes on express not stopping at my work bus stop. Wow, amazing, striking 4D would be easier. \n\nLooks like I will eventually need to drive to work which is such a waste as the distance is so near. Taking the bus is hectic (For a 60+ year old) as the last bus is always crowded and it often is late due to jams on the PIE. Going home is no ride in the park as well and it gets worst when it rains.

      "selftext": "This happened a few minutes ago and I just want to rant, so bear with me hehe\n\nI was standing under a taxi stand sign waiting for a cab. There’s no railing there, but it’s the usual informal system, the unspoken rule per se: the first person stands under the sign, others queue behind.\n\nA lady arrived after me, walked past me, and stood in front of me, maybe 4 to 5 ft away. I found it odd but didn’t immediately say anything. She was on her phone, so I thought maybe she was waiting for someone. After some time, a few people were already queueing behind me\n\nWhen a taxi came, we both flagged it. I said, \"Hello, I was here first, there’s already a queue\"\n\nShe replied, “Since when?”\n\nI said, \"Since before you arrived.\" (wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt maybe she ddnt notice but I was literally standing there the whole time in a bright coloured shirt, there's no way she didn't saw me right??, I know some might think it’s a crime, but c’mon, I like my shirt hahaha.)\n\nThere was about 5 seconds of awkward silence, and even the taxi uncle gave a small beep.\n\nThen she said, \"Ok you take lah!\" in a pretty annoyed tone. I took the taxi.\n\nNow I’m wondering, AITA for insisting? In my mind I was like, \"Not my first rodeo, lady.\" 😏 A few similar instances have happened to me before, and I tend to stand my ground if the person looks around my age.\n\nI know it’s morning rush hour and everyone’s rushing to work. But at the same time, isn’t there a basic taxi stand etiquette? Also, I realized I tend to feel more intimidated if it’s older people doing this. I get scared to confront them. But if it’s someone around my age, I can stand my ground.\n\nWas I being unreasonable for speaking up? All I want to say to the people who cut queues; I hope someone calls you out on the spot!!! And have some shame!!!",

Call 995 ( inform the exact location and number of victims , if they are stuck in a car etc).\n\n2. Dont move victim\n\n3. Use Umbrella to help shade Victims from Sun/Rain \n\n4. Call out for anyone who has first aid /BCLS training / find the nearest AED ( check locations on myresponder app ) \n\n5. Ensure the victim is conscious/has a heart beat if not administer CPR \n\n6.  Help to clear/redirect traffic if its not on a highway.. \n\n7. Help with crowd control/clearing the crowd\n\n8. If there's a GP clinic nearby , run and get a doctor to help. \n\n9.

Where are your parent’s cards and cash stored? How much money in their bank account? Do you need financial aid? Approach your nearest family service centre or Social service office for assistance. \n\n2) Valuables - Where is everyone’s passports and nrics and other valuables. In the event of a fire or housebreak-in, do you know where to find them to make sure they are still there? \n\n3) Bills- Tax, Internet, Phone, Gas, Water supply and Electricity - they should have payment instructions on their website and also a phone number to call to find out if you have outstanding bills\n\n3.5) Debt and loans - Ask your parents if they owe anyone money. Are they still repaying a car or HDB loan or insurance premium? Need to figure out how to continue w monthly payments if needed. \n\n4) Communication - If your parents are working and were detained suddenly, there might be employers or concerned friends calling wondering where they might be. Be prepared for an answer acceptable to you? If your parents were known to social service before, do you know how you can reach their social workers for help?\nIf any of your parents friends or people in their drug consumption network approach u looking for them for whatever reasons- learn how to keep urself and grandma safe in case things go sideway. \n\n5) Medicine - Check if your grandma has any medicine she needs to take daily and where they are located. Can go to her GP or polyclinic to restock as they should have her records.\n\n6) HYGIENE - A house can get dirty really fast. Clean toilet and bathroom at least once a week. Do not mix bleach with toilet cleaner!!!! It will produce toxic gases. So yah I learned that the hard way the first time I cleaned my bathroom. Please for the love of everything do not anyhow mix cleaning chemicals just because they all advertise it can clean bathrooms. \nDo not let laundry pile up. Learn how to use washing machine, and iron. \n\n6.5) Food safety: Check your current food supplies and clear expired ones. Clear old food from refrigerators regularly - fresh fruit and veg can go bad in a week. check internet for food safety when cooking and food storage. Watch for mold. Usually if you dabao food don’t keep in fridge for more than two days. Try not to leave cooked food in room temperature for days. Also check if your containers can be microwaved - some cannot. No metal utensils on non-stick coating cos the surface will scratch and release toxic chemicals. Do NOT put metallic objects in a microwave unless they say its microwave safe. \n\n7) Emergency - if locked out or something leaking or spoil, save number of locksmith, 24/7 plumber, electrician, internet provider number in case got blackout. Learn where your house circuit breaker is and how it works in case power trips\n\n8) Community Support - This is a stressful time and you shouldn’t do it alone! Get help if you must! No shame ok there are more people willing to help someone whose parents are separated from them. Get to know your neighbours, religious community if any, and call your friends. They can help u with chores or getting stuff or just lending a listening ear. We are not meant to do this alone.\n\nJiayous!",

Assuming you work until 65, with your salary increasing at a rate of 4% a year (meaning no meaningful increment), you'll only earn 1.5million by 65, less than half of what you need. \n\nIf you halve your spending and spend 1.5k a month, you'll need 1.6million over those 44 years. Still less than what you'll earn, but that shortfall can be covered by your CPF. You might even be able to pay off a 2 room HDB if you invest your savings. \n\nChange your mindset, halve your spending and you'll be okay. You won't be rich, but you'll be okay. If you want to be able to spend more, you need to earn more.",

The thing is, it is not easy getting a queue number and i only managed to book a flat when i was 40 after my 2nd try (you really have to manage your expectations because it's very competitive for 2 room bto and unless you are ok with standard, i think it'd be even harder if you have set your sights on Plus or Prime areas). \n\nDue to the loooong runway till the completion of my bto project, the HDB officer shared that i might even be able to fully pay off the flat by the time it's finally done (don't even need to get any HDB loan). \n\nSo start trying now. Just bear in mind that you'd have to pay an additional +$15k on top of your flat cost  (i call it the singles tax). You can consider taking HDB's optional component scheme (opting in flooring, wash basin/shower fittings) which is another add on $3.3K - $3.5K (?) if you want some cost savings (&amp; are not picky). All payable through cpf.\n\nI think it puts things into perspective once you get your flat. I was like you too, yolo-ing etc. But after the booking, my mindset changed and i looked at my finances and started saving. \n\nMy only regret was not trying sooner for a flat, everything else is secondary.

The 110k is total CPF or just OA? \n\nYou need to use a mortgage calculator to check, and also take note of how CPF allocation to OA goes down when you get older (https://www.cpf.gov.sg/service/sfc/servlet.shepherd/document/download/069IW00000DZMxZYAX)\n\nbut at least initially, you should be able to pay the mortgage entirely from future CPF OA contributions. Even if it’s a 200k flat and you need to loan 150k, mortgage payment for a 20 year loan (say your key collection is when you’re 45) is ~$800. For a 4k salary hob with CPF, about that much should be going to OA each month. \n\nAlso, you shouldn’t need to loan that much because you will be accumulating CPF OA in the years when the flat is being built.\n\nThe most important thing is you need to stay employed! The CPF policy is designed to protect people like you from your spending habits. \n\nGo ahead and apply for HDB HFE income assessment, do your research on how the system works, and start balloting.

However, Grab didn’t make much sense to me as a mere 5 minute drive could cost between RM10-12. As we’re earning RM, you can imagine it as $12 for 5 mins drive. If you’re wondering “why not just walk lah”, I’m sorry, pedestrian infrastructure are virtually nonexistent here 😆 it’s unsafe at some parts of town and there are almost no proper sidewalks to walk on 🥲Touristy places like KSL or Eco Botanic are not like the local neighbourhoods of JB. \n\nBecause of this, I started to stay home more, and my lifestyle slowly changed. I was less active, I think my step counter reduced from 8k in SG to less than 2k in JB per day 🥲 I really (and still) miss the ease of walking in SG v much! \n\nMany Singaporeans think that living in JB/Malaysia is cheap. But most do not realize that the salary earned in Malaysia are actually the same in SG. A uni grad in SG may get a starting salary of $4k, but in JB, the same job may get you RM3.5k only. For the same $ you pay in RM, the quality you receive may also not be the same as what you get. For instance, $1.5k can get you an iPhone 17, but at RM1.5k? Settle for Realme please. (No shade to Realme though!) I truly feel the difference in life quality ever since moving to JB. Even though we earn a decent amount from our business, it’s still a difficult pill to swallow to have to pay RM7 for eggs 😅 \n\nThat saying, I don’t regret moving to JB and will probably make the same decision if given an opportunity again!",

On the other side of the grandmother, there was also a boy who I assume is her brother (maybe around 10-12 years old). All of a sudden, this extremely angry woman (who I assume is their mother) stormed towards them while screaming at the top of her lungs, and when she got close to the girl, she started hitting the girl very hard while continuously yelling at the girl and the grandmother. She slapped the girl's face very hard twice and also hit her on the back while berating her in front of everyone.

The mom, girl, grandmother, and boy walked off quickly as the mom was rushing them away while continuing to yell at them very loudly. As they walked away, I paused and stood there in shock. I'm still thinking about it a few days later, and I'm now wondering if I should have said or done something to intervene at the moment. Again, there was a language barrier here, so l have no idea what she was so upset about, but nothing, absolutely nothing can justify slapping a child across the face so hard and hitting a child in anger like that.

I actually have audio recordings of a physical assault that I showcased in court to eventually gain custody.\n\nMy daughter is now healing well, but that trauma and the marks of her self harm period remains as a reminder of what could have happened.\n\nSo if I ever see you as a parent using undue force against a child, I will f _you_ up, adult to adult, because i have zero patience or respect for a bully parading as a parent. Next time you want to pick hands on someone, do it to one of your own weight class.\n\n*A child looks up to an adult as a dependant - for safety, for protection, for provisional food and clothing. You abuse that trust while going on a power trip makes you nothing worthy of the air around you.*\n\nDownvote if you wish, i dont care.

Over the last two years, I had already been traveling frequently—about 40 days per year—under my previous company’s work-from-anywhere (WFA) policy, which allowed me to test different locations across Southeast Asia. So far, I’ve spent time in various parts of Thailand, Vietnam, and most recently Cambodia.\n\nAfter being retrenched last year, I started working on my own startup, which currently earns around SGD 3,000 per month. In many Southeast Asian countries, that income allows for a relatively comfortable lifestyle.\n\nI am currently based in Cambodia and have been living here for about two months. Although Cambodia sometimes has a negative reputation due to scams or safety concerns, I’ve personally found the quality of life here to be quite decent—especially compared to Singapore. The visa process is also significantly easier than in countries like Thailand or Vietnam.\n\nIn Phnom Penh, a one-bedroom apartment with a pool and gym typically costs around SGD 700 per month, excluding utilities. Food expenses average about SGD 20–30 per day if I dine at cafés or restaurants, and can drop to around SGD 10 per day if I eat local meals.\n\nOverall, my monthly expenses are usually around SGD 2,000 if I live normally, and could be optimized further by shopping more locally. Recently, my spending went above SGD 3,000 because I’ve been exploring—visiting places like Siem Reap and Kampot, and occasionally enjoying nightlife. I’ve intentionally given myself about a year of financial runway to experiment with this lifestyle.\n\nLike you, I don’t prioritize material comfort as much as experiences. I enjoy exploring new places, nature, cafés, beaches, and different cultures. I’m also currently learning how to ride a motorbike so I can explore more independently.\n\nMy favorite places so far have been Koh Samui in Thailand and Da Nang in Vietnam. Next, I’m planning to explore Cebu City for its beaches and nightlife.\n\nUltimately, the decision is very personal. There are many countries where you can live affordably due to currency differences. I highly recommend doing a trial stay before committing long-term—living somewhere as a tourist is very different from actually living there day-to-day.\n\nHope this helps, and I’m happy to chat with anyone who’s interested in exploring this path.\n\n",

I would also say straight up that B1 is not enough, B2 gives you a bit of chance but for foreigners you’d need at least C1 to have a strong chance. \n\nBeyond language you also need a recognised degree because France does not recognise all university certificates+ they are minimum masters only. \n\nFriendships are not easy to come by and if you don’t speak the language you might end up only hanging out with other foreigners/expats.

The societal system in India allows the upper caste to get away with all kinds of crimes. Now, when a pro-CECA government like PAP shields these people, it further amplifies their ego that they are sovereign and above the law. Previous Ceca cases such as Ramesh Erramalli who worked in JP Morgan with a fake degree, has shown the other Cecas in Singapore that they can abuse people and get away with it. Hence, I have absolutely no faith in the justice system that this Ceca driver would get the appropriate punishments.\n\nOn my part, I don't support any pro-CECA party otherwise I won't be able to sleep at night, the PAP MPs who knock on my door every GE knows that I only have one request, that's to abolish CECA for the collective benefit of Singaporeans, I told them not to bother speaking to me until CECA is abolished, then overtime the door knock stops, because they know this request is impossible to fulfill as it's their fundamental core policy which is existential to their political survival.",

While walking through the car park near the Chinese temple at Maxwell MRT, I witnessed a traffic accident at around 11:40 a.m. today. It was the first time in my life that I saw a traffic accident happen right in front of me.\n\nI was the first person walking behind the mother and her daughter. A woman was driving out from the car park. She did not look to the right for pedestrians; she only looked to the left when she turned right. The front wheel of her car ran over the little girl’s abdomen first, then over the mother’s leg. After that, the woman pressed the accelerator hard, and the rear wheel ran over the mother’s abdomen again.\n\nI don’t know why she accelerated so quickly when she just exited the car park. I guess they might be tourists. I can help as a witness and testify about this traffic accident.\n\nI clearly saw that when the front wheel ran over them, the driver should have felt that there was something under the wheel. However, she did not stop to get out of the car to check. Instead, she accelerated strongly and continued to drive forward, which caused the rear wheel to run over the mother’s abdomen again.\n\nI panicked at that moment and cannot remember clearly whether the rear wheel ran over the little girl again. I was in shock when the incident happened right in front of me.\n\nAt the time of the accident, the husband was not with them. Only the mother and daughter were there, and I was walking behind them. About two minutes later, the husband ran over and hugged the little girl.\n\nWhen the front wheel ran over the little girl, she was thrown and rolled about three times and ended up lying face down on the ground. Her mouth was in a pool of blood, next to her water bottle and her camera. The blood was flowing heavily from her mouth and spread thickly on the road.\n\nWhen the woman got out of the car and went to the back to check, she then realized that she had caused the accident. She raised her voice at the father while their daughter was injured and kept trying to explain that she was not at fault.",

The driver still fking go tug on the kids hand??? Tf????? \n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/share/v/1K1Gmp2Rrj/\n---\n\n“This morning I walked to the market to buy coriander to make bánh mì. Because I forgot to order coriander, I went to the market and then witnessed a traffic accident this morning in the car park of the Chinese temple near Maxwell MRT. This was the first time in my life that I witnessed a traffic accident happen right in front of me, at around 11:40 a.m. today.\n\nI was the first person walking behind a mother and her child. A woman was driving out from the car park and did not look to her right for pedestrians; she only looked to her left while turning right. Then the front wheel of her car ran over the little girl’s stomach, after that it ran over the mother’s leg, and then the woman suddenly stepped hard on the accelerator, causing the rear wheel to run over the mother’s stomach. I don’t know why she accelerated so quickly right after exiting the car park. I guess they’re tourists. I can help and might be the one to testify in the traffic accident.\n\nI saw very clearly that when the accident happened, the front wheel had already run over a person and the driver should have felt that there was something under the car, but she did not stop to get out and check. Instead, she accelerated strongly and continued driving, which caused the rear wheel to run over the mother’s stomach one more time. I panicked and cannot remember clearly whether the rear wheel ran over the little girl again — I really can’t remember because I was in shock from what happened in front of me.\n\nAt the time of the accident, the woman’s husband was not with her — only the mother and child were there, and I was walking behind them. About two minutes later, the husband ran over and held the little girl in his arms. When the front wheel ran over the little girl, she rolled three times and ended up lying face down on the ground, with her mouth bleeding heavily. The father used a water bottle and a camera to block the blood, but the blood from the child’s mouth flowed a lot and spread all over the road.\n\nWhen the woman got out of the car from the back to look, she then realized that she had caused the accident. She shouted loudly at the father who was holding his daughter, and she tried to explain that she was not at fault.”\n",

Singaporeans were a massive **82%** majority, meaning almost everyone shared a permanent, lifelong stake in the nation. The streets were quieter and the social fabric was uniform, as the non-resident workforce was just beginning to expand. Back then, the country functioned as a tight-knit nation-state where the vast majority of people held voting rights and a multi-generational claim to the land.\n\nIn **2026**, the population has surged to **6.15 million**, yet the citizen share has shrunk to just **59%**. While the total population grew by **68%**, the non-resident group exploded by over **530%**, reaching nearly **2 million**. This demographic shift has transformed the island into a high-pressure global hub where citizens of the country are increasingly outnumbered by transient residents. The physical density is compounded by an ageing crisis, with **21%** of citizens now **over 65**, leaving a smaller core of local stakeholders to navigate an unrecognisably crowded city.\n\nCrucially, the **59%** citizen figure is **deceptive** because it ignores the distinction between natural-born and naturalised citizens. The data masks the influx of adults who may not share the local culture or have served National Service (for males). This internal shift means the proportion of \"traditional\" stakeholders with deep roots is even lower than official stats suggest. Today, the [native-born](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/native-born) Singaporean finds themselves in a city where nearly **1 in 3 people** is a temporary guest, fundamentally altering the sense of home that existed thirty years ago.\n\n_________\n**Tl;DR:** Since **1996**, Singapore's population has hit close to **6.2 million** while the citizen stake diluted from **82% to 59%**. This **59%** includes many new citizens who didn't grow up locally or serve NS, meaning traditional stakeholders now share a much denser country with **2 million** non-residents.

      "selftext": "Hi, long time lurker first time poster, using a burner account. I’m in my mid 30s and after working for a little over a decade, I’ve managed to accumulate about SGD 2 mil in liquid assets (not including my house and CPF). The screenshot provides some proof (my equity account). I don’t have generational wealth, but I’m very financially secure. \n\nThis financial security has made my life much, much better. These are my 3 favourite things about getting rich. \n\n1. **I can prioritise life over work.** \n\nMy kids had a bout of illness recently and I took time off work to care for them. As I went through my calendar for the month, I realised that on average, I had worked four days or less each week. And more importantly, I was never stressed about what this might mean for my work or my performance.\n\nThis mindset and ability to let go are new to me. I’ve always put my best into school and work, and this paid off. I scored well, got a high paying job, and promoted fast. But as my salary grew so did my stress, my belly, and the number of friendships I lost. So over the past two years I’ve consciously traded work to reverse these trends and spend more time with my family.\n\nWork-life balance looks different for everyone. I like but I don’t love my work, so having the peace of mind from my finances to no longer feel a strong need to work has absolutely done wonders for me. My family, health, and social life have taken priority over my work, and I feel a lot happier most days. \n\n2. **I have a portfolio that lets me sleep well at night**\n\nSince this is r/singaporefi I guess I should share my current portfolio. It’s roughly: 65% equities (LSE ETFs), 30%  cash and bonds, and 5% gold. \n\nCan I optimize my portfolio? Definitely. Given my age I should allocate more to riskier assets, maybe even crypto. In fact, I got rich not just through high savings from a high paying job, but also because my old portfolio was almost 100% equities with many stock picks (big tech) that did very well. \n\nBut my old portfolio was too risky and I often lost sleep over it. No longer. After crossing the SGD 1.5 mil mark I rebalanced it slowly to where it is now and I have never lost any sleep over my portfolio since then. Yet the returns on my suboptimised portfolio last year covered my \n\nentire annual expense. \n\nAnd that’s one of the best things about being rich. I don’t need to take financial risks. I don’t need to chase high returns. I don’t need to care about vagaries of the market. I can just do whatever preserves my wealth and lets me sleep best at night.\n\n3. **I spend whatever I want on people and things that make my life better.**\n\nMy family and I went to MBS last year. When we arrived we realised that we had forgotten one of our kids’ shoes. Driving home or letting kiddo walk around barefooted weren’t options. So we just waltzed into one of the atas MBS kids shop and picked up a ridic overpriced pair of kids shoes. In our calculus, it was more than worth it to spend three digits to save the effort of carrying our chonky kid around the whole day. \n\nI can’t afford to buy a GCB or a sports car or fancy watches. But I can take grab everywhere, order ala carte at restaurants, and fly premium economy. I can splurge on experiences like holidays and musicals with my parents and wife and kids. I can throw money at problems and buy time and convenience. And to me, these things are the best uses of money, and one of the greatest perks of being rich. \n\n——\n\nTL;DR Life gets much better as you get rich, but only if you let it.\n\nGood luck everyone!

      "selftext": "So finally, the broken clock is right. \n\nWith the huge downswing that we have seen in US markets, let's pause, take a step back, and rewind how this sell-off unfolded. \n\nIt all started with the SAAS companies, a little over 2 weeks ago. We saw major names in the software sector getting hit with sharp corrections on fears that AI and Claude, specifically, could disrupt their subscription based business model. \n\nThen earlier this week, we saw reports of friction between OpenAI and Nvidia, sparking a correction for the semiconductor sector. This week, after major tech giants reported an unprecedented, hyper-aggressive rise in capex spending, the entire tech sector just sold down. \n\nValuations are the single most crucial thing in investinng. Buying a super high quality business at a gargantuan valuation makes it a bad decision automatically. And by now, I'm sure that everyone would be familiar with the fact that what goes up, must come down. \n\nTo address the common wisdom that it's impossible to time a crash, and hence continously buying into US tech despite skyhigh valuations is justified, let me pose a simple question to you. Are you sure that the risk to reward ratio is in your favour? How probable is it that when the market continues to go up and tanks eventually, it will still be higher than the current price that you are buying it? \n\nMe personally, seeing this volatility, well, I'll be lying if I said it didn't feel soooo good to prove the haters wrong. But am I going to liquidate my position in my dividend stocks in HK and go all in on us tech? No. I'm going to continue to remain rationale. Should the valuations of the companies continue to go down, I may even start a SMALL TINY position in solid, blue chip US tech companies. But as of right now, I'll still be patiently waiting on the sidelines. \n\nTo those that saw huge drawdowns in your portfolio this week, please take a moment to pen down your thoughts and emotions. It really helps to guard against FOMO and hype chasing, a few months later down the road. Valuable lessons can be learnt from this drawdown.\n\nTo end with a quote, \"The stock market functions as a mechanism that transfers wealth from the impatient to the patient\". ~ Warren Buffett. \n",

The person said they offer free certifications and personality assessments, and mentioned exposure to financial consulting and client work.  Apparently graduates with no experience in the sector are welcomed too\n\nHowever, before the second round interview, they asked me to fill in a Google Form requesting quite personal financial details, including:\n\n\t•\tmonthly income / allowance\n\n\t•\tmonthly expenses\n\n\t•\ttotal savings\n\n\t•\tinvestment portfolio details\n\n\t•\twhether I have insurance\n\n\t•\tCPF balances\n\nThey also mentioned:\n\n\t•\tcertifications sponsorship\n\n\t•\tpersonality profiling\n\n\t•\tface-to-face meetings\n\n\t•\tpossible overseas exposure\n\nIt’s under an individual campaign name (“Lei On Me”) by a financial advisor (name given: Shi Lei Ho), not directly through a big company HR portal.\n\nHas anyone encountered similar programmes? Is this typically FA/insurance agent recruitment rather than a standard internship? IMO it already sounds like a MLM, or just an FA recruitment trap, but i wanna get some opinions, who knows, i do want to broaden my opportunities, just not sure if this is the way to go.\n\nI don’t have the ad link i applied to, but just provided a few of the questions i was asked to fill out \n\nWould appreciate any experiences or advice — thank you.",

Basically, I find that a lot of Singaporeans like to chase dividends in funds, sometimes to an irrational level. \n\nBasically how a fund would is the money from all the investors are pulled to buy shares. This allow investors to gain broad exposure to investments, some that they do not have direct access to. Other than ETFs which trade on the market, it should be noted that the fund price that you regularly see is based on the fund's investment portfolio, along with operational cash-equivalent entries (cash, receivables, payables). ETF are also priced this way, but because it's traded on a board, the trading price may move from the calculated price, but generally not to a big degree.\n\nNow, back to dividends. When a fund pays dividends, it is from a fund's assets. It will pay from it's cash, and if that is insufficient, it will sell some stocks to make up the difference. The corresponding effect is that a fund price will always fall after paying out the dividend, unless its portfolio movement makes up the difference.\n\nStocks are paid at investor's perceived value of the company and expected future cashflows. Dividends paid from stocks can have a positive impact on the perceived value and increase the stock price even when stocks pay out dividends. This does not happen with funds. Funds pay out dividends from assets that are already yours. You don't magically gain any value from dividends other than cashflow, which could be a valid reason to wanting dividends from some people.\n\nNow, something that even fewer people knows about. Dividends cost money to the fund. Fund administrators (the ones doing the operational work for the fund managers) typically charge a fee for each transaction to the fund. This includes dividends. And note that this is for each transaction. That means a flat fee is typically charged for each dividend transaction paid to each receiving investor. Typically, you are paying a small amount for each dividend you received. \n\nSo there you have it. Hope this post helps people understand the underlying mechanics a bit better and make wiser decisions.\n\n",

Because it’s a recycled number.\n\nSolution: get a telco confirmation letter from Singtel.\n\nJan 20 – Immediately emailed Singtel\n\nWeekend passed. No reply.\n\nJan 24 – Had to physically go down to Singtel store to get the letter\n\nQueue was long. Process slow.\n\nSubmitted everything to DBS.\n\nStill manual review 🤡\n\nJan 29 – Received email from DBS\n\nThought account was finally ready.\n\nNope.

Still no PIN.\n\nCalled again.\n\nCustomer service told me the PIN was supposed to be inside the envelope with the card.\n\nNow they’re asking if I want them to cancel the current card and reissue a new one.\n\nWhich means another 3–5 working days.\n\nAt this point, I feel like I’ve completed a government compliance obstacle course:\n\nMOM → Singpass → Telco → Bank → Mail → More mail\n\nI understand compliance and KYC are important. But the lack of data synchronisation between systems is insane. One missing record or recycled number and you’re stuck in manual review purgatory.\n\nFor a country known for efficiency, this was surprisingly painful.\n\nIs this normal for new foreign workers here?

These headlines are designed to attract attention, and often miss out the more nuanced aspects of the situation.\n\nFor the chinese economy growth to stall at 2.5% per annum, is a huge claim to make without solid evidence and proper financial models.

A somewhat deflationary mindset is beginning to set in -- no 'urgency' to consume now since inflation remains very low, and intense competition plus over-production from excess capacity means prices continue falling over time. This is why some are cautioning that China may fall into a similar deflationary spiral like Japan in the 90s, if more is not done to reform the economy.\n\nThere are also signs that China is experiencing a \"liquidity trap\". 30-year bond yields are ~2.2%, but credit impulse has not picked up meaningfully. Cuts to the RRR (reserve req ratio) unleashing liquidity into the financial system have not been meaningfully stimulatory.\n\nStock market-wise, it is quite clear policymakers are trying to engineer a gradual market rally, whilst trying to boost household participation in stocks in hopes of spurring consumption through the wealth effect. The \"National Team\" has been selling stocks so far this year (they were big buyers in 2024 to support the market). For Hong Kong-listed equities, daily southbound net buying through the StockConnect has materially slowed, and certainly days are actually seeing outflows. More importantly, earnings have not materially grown y/y at the index level, so last year's rally was mostly driven by valuation multiple expansion.\n\nGiven current circumstances, it seems that a slow grind higher in Chinese stocks is the most likely outcome for this year, barring a trade war re-escalation. We may come to a point where \"bad is good\" -- poor data forces policymakers to rollout more stimulus, that should ultimately benefit the stock market. Also quite unlikely that Chinese stocks catch up to their East Asian breathren given the absence of the AI thematic (Korea/Taiwan) or broad fiscal stimulus (Japan).",
