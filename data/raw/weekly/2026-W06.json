          "text": "It’s a classic \"grass is greener\" scenario: standing on a crowded North-South Line platform, watching a train stop at every single station, and wishing we had the express tracks of New York or Tokyo.\nBut in a city-state as compact as Singapore, the \"express\" dream is complicated. Does it improve connectivity? The answer is a nuanced \"Yes, but with massive trade-offs.\"\nHere is a critical assessment of why express trains aren't a simple \"ctrl+c, ctrl+v\" solution for Singapore.\n1. The Engineering Wall: The \"Two-Track\" Trap\nMost of Singapore’s MRT lines (NSL, EWL, NEL, DTL) are dual-tracked. To run an express train that skips stops, you need a way for the fast train to overtake the slow one.\n * The Problem: Without a third or fourth track (\"quad-tracking\"), an express train would just get stuck behind the local train ahead of it. It’s like a Ferrari trapped behind a tractor on a single-lane road.\n * The Cost: Building extra tracks underground in a land-scarce city is astronomically expensive. It requires wider tunnels, more land acquisition, and complex station designs.\n2. The \"Skip-Stop\" Penalty: A Social Equity Issue\nConnectivity isn't just about speed (v = \\frac{d}{t}); it’s about access.\nIn Singapore, the government prioritizes the \"15-minute town, 45-minute city\" goal. If we introduced express trains on existing lines, residents at smaller stations (like Khatib or Yio Chu Kang) might see their train frequency drop, effectively reducing their connectivity to improve it for those in Jurong or Woodlands.\n3. The Geometry of a Tiny Island\nExpress trains thrive when distances between stops are 5–10 km (like regional rail in Europe). In Singapore:\n * Average MRT station distance is roughly 1 to 1.5 km.\n * The train barely reaches its top speed before it has to start braking for the next station.\n * Verdict: For many routes, the \"time saved\" by skipping three stations might only be 4–5 minutes—hardly worth the billions in infrastructure.\n4. Where Express Actually Works in Singapore\nThe Land Transport Authority (LTA) isn't ignoring the idea; they are just applying it where it makes sense:\n * Cross Island Line (CRL): Designed with higher speeds and the potential for \"skip-stop\" patterns because it covers long, suburban-to-suburban distances.\n * RTS Link (Singapore-JB): A \"point-to-point\" express that solves a specific bottleneck.\n * The Hub-and-Spoke Model: Instead of express trains, Singapore uses Bus Integrated Hubs. High-capacity \"trunk\" MRT lines act as the spine, while feeders provide the \"capillaries.\" The Reality Check: Connectivity in Singapore is often measured by \"First and Last Mile\" ease. An express train that saves you 10 minutes doesn't help if you then have to wait 15 minutes for a feeder bus in the rain. Critical Verdict\nExpress trains do improve connectivity for the long-distance commuter, but in a high-density city-state, they often degrade connectivity for the average commuter by reducing frequency at intermediate stops.\nFor Singapore, the \"win\" isn't necessarily faster trains, but a denser network. The more \"loops\" (like the Circle Line and Cross Island Line) we have, the more direct paths become available, which naturally reduces travel time without needing to skip stops.",

The Tamil is தீபாவளி. The Hindi for 'lamp' is दीया,dīyā. When compounded withāvaliaccording to Hindi grammar rules, the word isdīwāli. A lot of noise is made by Hindi speakers (who are a significant minority in India) who don't realise their language has undergone significant changes compared to Sanskrit. One example isschwa deletion. For instance, the word in Sanskrit iskarma, कर्म, but it's pronounced 'karm' in Hindi (with the last 'uh' sound as in the first syllable of 'umbrella' deleted). This pronunciation in Sanskrit would be rendered as कर्म्. Compare with कर्म, and notice the little angled line,  ्  below the last character; this is called a हलन्त orhalantawhich suppresses the vowel sound into a pure consonant. This distinction does not exist when Hindi is spoken. (The wordhalantaisitselfschwa-deleted in Hindi ashalant). TL;DR: both pronunciations are OK, and represent different evolutions of two completely unrelated languages (Tamil is Dravidian, Hindi is Indo-Aryan). If in Singapore, Malaysia, Tamil Nadu or other parts of South India, err on the side of the common language and use 'Deepavali'; if elsewhere, ask where they're from.",

As expected, there are road closures and motorists are advised to take alternative routes. Our Indian friends have been celebrating Thaipusam for many years already.\n\nI was discussing with a coworker, and he mentioned he was quite relieved that it falls on a Sunday this year, so he doesn’t need to take leave. And it would be nice if everyone could get one more public holiday, since Chinese and Malays already have two religious holidays each.\n\nWhy hasn’t Thaipusam been made a public holiday by now ? When it falls on a weekday, many people take leave anyway, which affects productivity regardless. Wouldn’t it make more sense to just formalise it as a PH ?\n\nAlso, Vesak Day is celebrated by Buddhists, who are mostly Chinese. I'm yet to meet a Indian Buddhist so I’m not entirely sure why Vesak Day is grouped under Indian holiday. Might be there in other countries. Happy to be corrected on this.\n\nAlso there is another festival pongul for Indians which is celebrated for a few days. Atleast give us 1 more PH la.\n\nCurious to hear what others think.\n\nEdit : I understand there are many other Indian communities other than Tamil. Respect that. I want to focus on Thaipusam since it is widely known.\n\nEdit : like someone mentioned I won't be surprised we might get a founder's day before we get another PH for Indians lol.",

      "selftext": "I was thinking about how brands like Jollibee are so closely tied to Filipinos and a source of national pride that when it gets criticized(I believe there was a viral video from Benny blanco a couple of years ago where he criticized the food and basically Filipinos all rallied and descended against him). I guess you can say the same for Din Tai fung and Taiwan/taiwanese as well. Will Singaporeans ever have something that maybe not even all, but at least most Singaporeans are proud of?\n\nSIA is probably the biggest international name but Singaporeans openly criticize it for the current high prices and 'drop in standards'. I'm guessing something in the luxury segment like SIA is, will struggle to capture the mass population of singapore\n\nFood wise I can only think of Ya Kun and Tiger beer, but I don't think neither brand really leans into national pride and I also often see people ranting about how much the price of ya kun has gone up.\n\nOn the flip side, whenever there are new local business that start up, I often see comments like 'confirm close after a year'. Is this overall just a sinkie pwn sinkie mentality that prevents local brands from thriving and becoming something that most locals can be proud of?",

I’m curious how accurate this sounds to locals.\n\nLevel 1: You own a dogHaving a dog in Singapore is expensive. Vaccinations, vets, permits, general upkeep, it all adds up fast. According to them, if you see someone walking a dog, that person is definitely not poor.\n\nLevel 2: You own a carCar ownership is on another level. They said it’s roughly two to three times more expensive than in Dubai. Import duties, insurance, and especially the licence to own a car make it prohibitive. We roughly calculated that a Mercedes E-Class could end up costing around USD 300k.\n\nLevel 3: You have two or more childrenThis was described as the real “wealth tier”. Education is extremely expensive, nannies are costly, and then you add extracurriculars, clubs, activities, camps, and so on. If you’re raising two or more kids in Singapore, you’re doing very well financially.\n\nDoes this way of looking at wealth in Singapore resonate at all, or does it sound off? How would you personally describe the so called levels of wealth?\n\nGenuinely curious to hear local perspectives.",

          "text": "My 2-cents is that you’re desperate for a happy ever after. And by being desperate, you’re ignoring red flags, giving chances to people who don’t deserve, etc. The guys are essentially taking advantage of you,m - they sense your desperation. I fear, if you continue down this road, you might actually get your partner and perhaps even a BTO, but it may not have the happy ending you desire. Sometimes or often times, depending who you read, family trauma and parents’ bad behavior has a way of repeating itself in the next generation. So thread carefully. As others have said, love yourself first, understand your self-worth and try to not settle too much - the fundamentals must be strong. Life will throw lots of crap at you - financials, loss of loved ones, loss of job, illness, etc. - so you need to be with someone true and genuine. On top of all that, there’s also the possibility that people change in the course of the relationship. So, if the foundation is weak, in all likelihood, the relationship may not be able to withstand the stress tests the future may throw at you. A BTO is important, but not the be all and end all. How will you maintain payments if you split up later? You may end up at square one all over again - wiser maybe but certainly older. And with age, it may be even harder to find a partner. Don’t rush, be happy and it will come to you.  Singapore trains you to plan and prepare for everything, almost as if you were a robot or an AI prompt. But not all things can be planned and prepared for to the nth degree. Alternatively, become more pragmatic and aim for a marriage of (BTO) convenience. That way, you may get your BTO but your relationship may be slightly non-conventional terms. Both are viable options - as long as you go into it with your eyes wide open and are aware of the consequences. There’s no right answer in life - to each their own, and by the same measure, to each their own consequence. Stay strong - love and the BTO will come to you when you least expect it!

But I looked at their life choices (relationship wise), at the people they became, and I told myself that I never wanted to become like them. I was single for a very long time before I met my spouse, and we've been together for over a decade now. Ofc when you are young (and you ARE young!), it is easy to think that a relationship would become your shelter from the world. But that isn't the answer. Growing up, I spent a lot of time by myself. I think that's when you learn who you are as a person, when you develop your own inner world. Being by yourself forces you to be comfortable in your own skin.  So don't be afraid to be alone. You might be stronger than you think. Focus on healing yourself first. Focus on giving yourself space and time to process your upbringing.

You are worthy of love. Don't let anyone tell you that otherwise. You deserve someone that worships the ground you walk on. I was in this situation as well. I had exes that cheated on me. I too, broke up with one ex due to too many issues. Compatibility wise - he wanted kids, I didn't. I got a job offer in London, and he wanted to stay in SG. He also felt that I gained too much weight - this was when I realised the love was conditional af. And we too, selected our BTO. It was a lot of pain, but luckily the loss was only a few grand, we didn't pay the downpayment yet. In the grand scheme of things, I am glad I dodged a bullet. Because later the down the line, a divorce would be messy and more expensive than a few grand. Rather be happy single than in an unhappy marriage. What worked for me was that I realised that nobody actually gives a fuck about you lol as in no one is caring about whether you look good in front of them or not. Because I have realised that I don't really care much about other people, so I think the same of how other people would see me. The earlier you realise this, and let go of all of these thoughts about comparing yourself to other people, the earlier you will become happier. Secondly, sorry this might be a bit out of touch but when you can afford it: travel - lots of solo travel to random places fixed me; travelling with friends and making the best memories is also super amazing.

      "selftext": "Hi all, I have worked in the government job for 10 years, had various stints at statboard and ministries alike. most of the times, I get C or C+, though I never gotten Bs, but I was never the worst performer. Last week, I had been called in for a performance review to be put on PRP.\n\nGranted I am not a stellar performer, but I do my job diligently and try my best. In the first year, I think I was not performing up to standard according to my boss and was asked what are the reasons. I explained that I think there is a job mismatch but I will try my best to learn. However, I find the directions given to me very vague and a lot of times, I just could not nail it. My boss also mentioned that when she hired me, she thought that I am well-versed in handling media. However, I mostly did events  where some were quite high profile and were covered by medias. I guess it is on me that I thought that those were the same as media engagement.\n\nAfter 6 months, I realised that the scope of work is totally off and anything I proposed were just getting shot down. After that, I lost confidence and kept a low profile. I began doing menial tasks, get heavily involved in other department's work. after 1.5 years, I really just cant seem to get the grip of things.\n\nThat said, my bosses were not great, in fact, the entire department were complaining and looking for other job themselves. Naturally, I started the same and was lucky that I scored some interviews. Recently, I have a few second round interviews with other ministries/agencies, and am waiting for official offer.\n\nHowever, last week's performance review came, and they say that my grading will be recorded and it would be shared throughout the entire government record. They indirectly advise me to leave asap but I was adamant to stay for the bonus. We ended with that I will resign when I qualify for my bonus, which when she said to me that my \"bad\" grading would be included and stay in government records forever, and I better secure the offer before its being included as it would affect my future opportunities.\n\nAlso, not to play the blame game, my bosses are getting absolutely pummeled by the senior management team. Our senior management also commented that the middle management (my bosses) are not up to standard, which further validates my view that as much as I am not up to standard, they cannot just pin all the blames on me alone...\n\nLet say in worse case scenario, I get Ds/Es, how screwed am I? Also, I am afraid that once the PRP sets in, HR would inform my potential new hiring agency/ministry that I am currently on PRP and drop me after HR checks... thanks in advance!\n\n*Edit: My bosses also claimed to have provided email coaching, which for the record, I do not receive much. There is not even face to face consultation. When she asked for a piece of work, I would complete it, check through with my colleague (who is supposedly the best performer) and get her green light. But she will come back with not good enough etc. I have recorded and documented our last 3 months email exchanges and I am quite sure not one is a 'coaching' email... Heck, what is 'receiving coaching through emails' anyway???",

For example:https://io.mlaw.gov.sg/debt-repayment-scheme/about-debt-repayment-scheme/ Since the amount is less than 150K after selling the car to pay the loan, this option is available. However, need to ownself calculate a bit. If he can drive Grab (as a side gig) and make more than the required amount to pay off every month using the debt repayment scheme, then it would be wiser to just go with option 2. edit: assuming OP's friend sold the car and he's left with 100K payment. The debt repayment scheme allows you to manage the debt but musn't be more than 5 years. So, at best, it would be around $1,677 per month. That means he has to find a side gig or cut down on his expenses. I would personally  go with option 3... Rather bite the bullet than suffer the pain and uncertainty in the long run. You don't know if the car breaks down and how much the repairs would be in the next 10 years or so.

One of the more upvoted comments even said that the average height of the younger generation is at least 180 cm.\n\nIf this were true, it would mean Singaporeans are now among the tallest populations worldwide, at about 10 cm above the global average, surpassing many developed Western countries such as the US and Canada, and almost comparable to the Netherlands people who are considered the tallest in the world.\n\nHow are Singaporean kids getting so tall?",

If u dont have any of that, then i think it’s time to brush or pick up some skills… youtube and chatGpt is a good source to develop one. Interviewers would be interested in ur thought process during the creation of the app/site - why did u design it this way? How did u do this login page or how do u authenticate and authorise the users? Is the site/app scalable? What’s the architectural design behind this (mvc, mvvm etc)? Thats only if u dont have buffed portfolios like 90% of the fresh grads out there… i have some crazy fresh grad friends that participated/won hackathons, interned at some big named companies and/or has personal projects that can blow one’s minds… Make ur resume stand out and highlight ur best points, essentially coming back to my point - sell the shit out of urself. Always ask urself why would they want u? I hope that helps, good luck!",

          "text": "Based on the new updates am essentially a fresh grad no real swe experience and in tech Yeah. Tech industry is incredibly terrible right now due to multiple of factors (e.g. AI, Trump, outsourcing, weaken economic outlook, tech bubble burst, bootcamps) I know a couple of 5 to 10 years veterans who are still jobless for more than a year now. The situation is much more grim for fresh graduates who is now completing with more experienced professionals who is willing to price themselves lower. I also notice the tone from tech recruiters who give career advise have change and become more pessimistic, from \"Just cold call and tailor your resume, you will land a role within months\" to \"Expect not being able to get in the industry for 1 to 2 years\" i applied even to listings up to a month old and i focused on all tech entry level jobs or jobs not directly tech but accepted tech background, these contribute to the high numbers Is good that you apply for adjacent roles, consider applying for roles that need your skills and capabilities, even if is not an even 50% match from your expectations. Here is what I recommend/suggest: Option A - If you really really want to get into tech: A stellar resume. A lot lecturers and some career consultant give shit advise on resume because they have been out of the force for a quite awhile. Avoid those aesthetics resume, I notice a lot of my SWE pals have \"fun\" looking resumes that are very difficult to read for HR/recruiter, so they end up in the discard pile. See what common phases and keywords that is written in the JDs, try to input those keywords organically and tailor it. Use ChatGPT if you need help but DON'T BLINDLY ACCEPT IT, take a scan, it has tendencies input random achievements. Expand your network via hackathons, voluntary, networking events if someone has a connection in a role you are interested in they can refer you in organisations or give you advise. This also shows you are passionate about the field. I landed in my current role, because I met 2 people in a community event, one of them give me tips on what to say for that company and other is the colleague of the interviewer, so they vouched for me. Upskill yourself, show you are passionate and willing to learn. Explain how such skills/courses make you a more valuable employee. \"I learn x software, which means I can assist and read Y\". As you scan the JDs, keep a lookout on common skills and keywords they used. Continue be open to roles is adjacent to the industry and roles you have the skill for, since you need a foot in. Example, data analytic, Quality Assurance, Business Analytics, IT Support etc. Lastly, I want to acknowledge the feeling and the experience you have is valid, the economy for tech is bad. Is quite common for people who end up in jobs that they didn't study for in.",

I help out when I can, but honestly it’s really shag. It is physically tiring, mentally draining, and financially quite stressful. I used to work corporate, but have taken a step back because it feels like such a waste if no one continues this, and serving local food we are proud of.\n\nWe’re on our feet for hours. And when there are no customers, it doesn’t mean we’re resting, there’s always prep, cleaning, stocking up, paperwork. There’s almost no real “break”, just different kinds of work.\n\nManpower is a constant headache too. Hiring non-local staff is getting harder with all the rules, and locals understandably expect higher pay because living costs here are no joke. We really want to pay more and hire more locals, but our margins are already super thin. Rent keeps going up. Supplier prices keep increasing. Utilities, ingredients, packaging, wages, everything has gone up.\n\nThen there’s the customer side. Most are nice, and we’re very grateful. But sometimes we meet really unreasonable people who treat us like we owe them something. It can be quite disheartening. Some days we just look at each other and wonder… is it even worth continuing?\n\nWhenever we adjust prices to keep up with rising costs, there will definitely be complaints. But the truth is, we’re always trying to balance being affordable with simply surviving. We can’t compete with big chains and multinational brands that have scale, systems, and pricing power that us small local businesses just don’t have.\n\nWe’re always thankful for every bit of support, but there’s this constant worry about whether its sustainable. Behind the scenes, it’s a daily struggle to make the numbers work, while still serving food we’re proud of.\n\nTo those who are patient, who understand that small businesses are run by very tired humans just doing their best, rly thank you 😭\n\nJust curious, what makes you choose to support a local business and when will people be willing to start paying more for local food?",

Daily eateriesFor places I visit multiple times a week, I expect predictable speed, consistent taste, and good value for money. 2. Date-night placesWe usually don’t visit a date-night place more than three times a year. What I expect here is great food, pricing that doesn’t feel exploitative, and service that’s at least a 4+/5. Minor service hiccups are fine. At least two out of the four dishes we order should be exceptional. One place that executes this well is Dumpling Darlings. 3. Nostalgia placesThese are legacy businesses or places known for classic dishes. My expectations here are lower in some ways. I forgive bad service because I know how hard it is to keep these places running. I even forgive price hikes, as long as they aren’t astronomical. But the food must taste the same as it always did. The day my soon kueh place or laksa stall starts cutting corners, I stop going. I understand there will always be some variability due to sourcing or preparation, but it needs to be good at least four out of five times. There are many great examples of this category—my top spot is Joo Siah BKT at Chinese Garden, which I visit religiously. That said, I’ve stopped going to many places because it’s obvious they no longer maintain quality. 4. Milestone placesThese are for big moments—birthdays with a zero in them, important anniversaries, reunions—events where the food becomes part of the memory. Here, I expect near-flawless execution. I don’t want a single variable I need to worry about. Prices can be high, but they must be earned. Most dishes should be excellent, and ideally, memorable. Across all categories, there’s one non-negotiable: the food should actually be cooked. I’ve encountered too many places where food is centrally prepared by a vendor and the restaurant is essentially a glorified microwave. I hope such places slowly shut down and realize this isn’t acceptable. If I want reheated frozen food, I’ll get it from FairPrice.",

A lot of people think quality and effort automatically brings people to your food through word of mouth, but I think peoples eating habits are so different now. People dont hang out at hawkers like the uncles do, they hang out at malls. You meet at a mall and then u find some food nearby. Your game is then not to just provide consistency and value because youre not appealing to the people around you. Your game becomes how can you build a name for yourself that people will talk about. USP:When I eat your food it has to make me think \"damn theres this thing about your food that is so amazing, if anyone ever mentions this I need to talk about it\". It also has to appeal to the listener. Think about the long lines outside hot hideout, what are people there for? The lotus root ,potato chips, scrambled egg, literally cant get them in any other mala, and its something the listeners will perk up for. Branding:Also the name is quotable, not like bedok 553 hokkien mee, id literally forget that name the moment the convo changes. There are a lot of hawker stalls that my friends have recommended me before and they are daaamn good like id gone back multiple times cos I actually liked it.

Photos on Maps + consistent name across signboard, GrabFood, IG all matter more than people realise. On marketing, I’d test one platform first (usually IG or TikTok), post simple behind-the-scenes and “how we cook this” clips, and reply to local food threads on Reddit/Telegram when people ask for recs. Tools like Meta Business Suite, Google Business Profile and Pulse for Reddit are decent for this kind of low-budget, “show up where people are already talking” approach. Main thing: one memorable dish, one clear name, one main channel, and you iterate from there.",

Then I have to get them home as quickly as possible while they are screaming at the top of their lungs the whole way.\n\nFirst of all, I'm really sorry for this.\n\nSecondly, I really want to know how people navigate issues like this when you are constantly surrounded by people that have to suffer from your kid's outbursts.

And like everyone said, give your kids time to acclimate. They're not used to the new sights, sounds and the crowds. Try and stay close to home for the time being, so if they get upset by anything, you can bring them back to let them calm down in a familiar environment. If you need to take public transport, than do short distance trips first. Like 2-3 stops, which would be around a 10 minute train ride. Enough to get them slowly familiar with riding the train and it's a short enough trip that they won't get too overstimulated. Also bring them to more outdoor places, like parks and gardens. It'll be quieter and less crowded than a shopping mall. Plus most parks have a playground area so they can burn off energy and distract themselves with playing. Basically don't rush the process. Instead of doing full day trips with cranky children, do a shorter outing in the morning, go home to rest and nap in the afternoon (so you also avoid the worse of this heat), and then spend the evenings somewhere nearby.

The goal isn’t the meat—it’s using a straw to suck out the rich, buttery bone marrow inside. It’s always served with sliced baguette to mop up the sauce, and it’s virtually impossible to eat without staining your fingers (and shirt) red. ​The Cheat Sheet ​The Vibe: Primal. You eat with your hands and make a mess.\n​The Taste: Like a spicy, savory tomato jam with a deep mutton finish. ​The \"Holy Grail\": The gelatinous marrow (the \"shake and tap\" or \"straw\" method). ​Pro Tip: Wear a black shirt. The red stain is permanent.\n​Where to go (The \"Big Three\"): ​Haji Kadir (Golden Mile): The OG. They claim to have invented it in the 50s.\n​Deen Tiga Rasa (Golden Mile): Known for a slightly more complex, \"three-flavor\" sauce.\n​M.A. Deen Biasa (Jalan Sultan): The \"King of Soup Tulang,\" popular for late-night supper.\n​Would you like me to map out a \"Mamak Route\" for you in the Beach Road/Golden Mile area?",

      "selftext": "I studied in the UK/US at a great uni and am currently serving my 6 year bond. My work thus far in the public service for an economic related Ministry/Statboard has been so bad and I honestly preferred my time serving NS in my chiong sua combat unit…. If I had known what it’d be like I would’ve passed on the scholarship and gone to local U happily\n\nMicromanaging bosses, meaningless paper pushing work, bizarre SOPs and internal office initiatives are bad enough. Realizing that I’m not developing any skills and that I will be so irrelevant to any decent company outside govt/SG after my bond is another thing entirely. I believe in helping the public and volunteer extensively outside in my local CC, so I came into the job a year ago with lots of enthusiasm but now I feel completely dead inside. I sense that my leaders + bosses + colleagues are mostly very uninspirational and do not care about excellence or actually creating impactful outcomes at work - they’re happy to show up and skate by on the bare minimum. Comparing this to NS in the army (which is also a govt organisation): at least I genuinely respected some of my NS regulars who were really damn good at certain aspects of their intense job. I can’t say the same about ANYONE where I work.\n\nWhile abroad, I interned at pretty good MNCs and had return offers, but of course I couldn’t take them due to the bond. Saw all my friends go on to earn big bucks but more importantly, open up way more doors for their future career trajectory by starting their career in coveted roles. Despite being initially promised exciting exposure to policy and shaping national strategies when I signed the scholarship, I’m now working in ultra-generalist menial roles that I genuinely think a secondary school kid could do. Feel like I was sold lies coming out of JC as I haven’t used my brain since joining or learnt a single useful thing that’d give me any leverage in the job market if I wanted to leave. The other scholars around and above me are all either resigned to their fate, or also horrendously unhappy. Why did the govt pay $500k for each of us to come back and rot?\n\nI feel like I’ve been pushed and pushed myself my whole life to excel ambitiously. But in govt, there’s hardly a no point (or benchmark) for achieving excellence because my work is so slow and detached from driving real outcomes, and the bonus structure doesn’t give me any real incentive to do so. This would be a great job if all I wanted to do was lepak and collect the steady paycheck but I feel like I am just wasting my life.\n\nI have actually made some money trading stocks and I am in a position to break my bond soon, am recruiting very heavily to get out of it which provides some solace. But man does it make me sad to realise how much time I wasted, and how the system here is wasting their human capital investments.\n\nAlmost every overseas scholar I’ve met across agencies and through friends hates their life and shares similar sentiments. Especially those that made the most of their experience abroad and didn’t just stay to the SG bubble.\n\nThe people at the top need to seriously re-examine how they develop talent or even hand out these scholarships - the current system is a product of a bygone era and sticking to it just will create a massive adverse selection problem for our country’s future. When your ‘brightest’ and most dynamic people come back to sub par opportunities, they’re gonna leave or break their bond ASAP. The yes men are predominantly the ones that stay in govt and rise up to become our future leaders and politicians. It’s very insular, and maybe this is why most new policies that come out of the government these days (especially related to job creation and upskilling) feels backward looking, behind the curve, and attempting to address problems from a highly detached position.\n\nAll I can say is, my exit interview will be glorious. Feel free to ask me anything, not like I’m doing anything important at work",

Not all, mind you, but it's quite a common complaint, and what I am guessing is that there is a disconnect between what you expect and what reality is. Because you are a scholar, you likely expect to hit the ground running and given opportunities to show your capabilities. Good or bad, this isn't how public sector works. It is slow, methodical, by the books, and unlikely to challenge you the way you expect or desire to be challenged. This was always going to be the gamble when taking up the offer, but this is no different from the private industry. If you get bonded, you have no idea if you're going to be in a place that's going to make good use of you and where you may learn something, or whether you get wasted and learn too little. You're in year one. Why not give it a fair shake with an open mind.

Anyway, this frail uncle comes up to me looking damn lost. He holds up his appointment card and asks me in Chinese how to get to tan tock seng. i could tell he was quite anxious so i spent a few mins checking the bus routes on my phone and explaining to him which stop to alight at.\n\nThen suddenly this middle-aged lady walks past, looks me up and down with the most disgusting face, and literally says out loud: \"Young girls nowadays no shame, dress like this come out and then still want to disturb old man.\"\n\nHUH??? i was literally just helping him? The uncle looked so confused and i was just stunned like vegetable. i didn't even have the energy to fight back cuz my legs were jelly from the workout, so i just ignored her, but she kept tsk-ing until she boarded her bus.\n\nLike i’m literally just existing in my gym clothes and doing a good deed? Since when did wearing a tank top and shorts become disturbing people? i feel bad for the uncle cuz he wasn’t feeling well and couldn’t explain himself and he thought he did something wrong too.\n\nReally upset.

I talked to my FA and first he says maybe can take policy loan and I am like bro, ILP can't take policy loan, and he say should be can, need to check with AIA. Then following day he say AIA says can't, then he suggest maybe I sell my policy to 3rd party companies and I called many companies, they don't buy in at 3 years. Then I ask him what other options can I do? He say if I withdraw, the charges is x4, meaning if I take out 1k, I must pay back AIA 4k. Then I ask again how? Then he blue tick me since then and it has been a month.\n\nOne thing I learnt is that FA really don't give a damn about you if you are in trouble, only when they want you to sign up something, they will keep pester you.",

          "text": "I believe it could be enough for one person. However, it depends on lifestyle. You need to consider inflation. First, the projections need to factor in inflation. Second, inflation rate is not actually equal for everyone. For the first point, you might need to relook at whether 1.3m in 2036 (11 years from now) is actually enough. For the second point, you will need to see what you are actually spending on. If you envision owning a car, multiple properties and frequent visits to hospital, those are things that are inflating at a very high rate in Singapore. So, inflation rate will be high. If you envision taking public transport, eating more hawker and having a relatively healthy life, inflation is not as high. Another thing people ignore is CPF. CPF is a bond-like instrument. Whether you like it or not, 37% of your income goes there so remember to factor it in. Assuming you have hit FRS, all excess above FRS can be taken out from 55 onwards. This means from 55 onwards, the interest from OA of 2.5% is perpetually available for you to take out and amount never goes down as long as you only take out the interest. From 65 onwards, CPF pays out around 6% of your RA annually. This means it is like a 6% perpetual bond (note it does eat into the RA amount but otherwise, it functions just like a perpetual bond). So in reality, you don't actually need as much to retire, provided you are ok to see your cash-funded assets go down before 55 before being supplemented later by cashflow from CPF. It does make calculations much more complicated but those are things that are usually ignored for a simpler 4%SWR. Also, the 4% SWR is already inflation-adjusted. Some people miss this point and even the researcher who came up with it says that people can actually draw up to 4+% (can't remember exact % but I guess you already know this) because again, another point people ignore is that in retirement, you usually spend less. No more travels, no more funding of kids' education, no more mortgages, etc. That said, the SWR is meant for a 30-year retirement based on the research. So nobody knows how it performs for longer period but in theory, you can just reduce the SWR for higher success or start with more. In any case, it is always good to err on side of caution but do also note that there are many people who retire on less than this amount TODAY in Singapore, granted the lifestyle will not be a glamorous 1. I suggest you first calculate the present value of 1.3m in 2036 then see if it meets what you feel would be enough today.",

Basically there was a bond bloodbath in 2022 when interest rates were jacked up (so older low interest bonds inside bond funds lost value.

You should also know that there are 2 versions of this fund. Yours is “icdiv” and there is another “irc”. https://www.ifastgm.com.sg/igm/admin/buy/highlight/highlightJPM139.pdf Dividends paid by “(irc)” share classes are further adjusted, up or down for, respectively, an estimated positive or negative interest rate carry.\nDividends paid by “(icdiv)” share classes are expected to include a distribution from\ncapital as well as the gains of the Share Class. It sets a predetermined percentage\nrate that is not linked to income or capital gains. During periods of negative performance, the dividend will normally continue to be paid and the value of the investment may fall more rapidly. The overall returns of the two versions are the same (can see on your FSM), but the “irc” dividend yield is only 6+%, while the NAV went up 5%. So I think the “real” dividend is 6%, and when the bond prices went up, your version “icdiv” gave out that gain as extra dividends to maintain the price.

I’m thankful that I’ve not faced unemployment — I always had another offer lined up before tendering, typically taking a short 1–2 month break between roles, clearing my ALs for self love.\n\nOver the past few months though, I’ve been feeling increasingly drained and unmotivated, with a fair bit of anxiety whenever the next day is a working day. It feels like there’s no clear “end point” to corporate life, unlike schooling where timelines were always defined.\n\nLately, I’ve been seriously considering stepping away from the corporate world after a few more years, perhaps take on a few months OR a year or two of break. Thereafter, possibly to pursue something more flexible (“own time, own target” - unfortunately I don’t have a concrete plan yet).\n\nThe main reason for staying on a few more years in the corporate world would be to build a larger buffer and investment portfolio, ideally one that can cover a good portion (or all) of my monthly expenses via passive income. That way, I feel that I will be less anxious about leaving my job at that point of time.\n\nWould appreciate perspectives from those who’ve done something similar:\n\nBefore leaving, did you aim for a specific portfolio size or expense multiple for peace of mind?\n\nHow old were you when you made the move?\n\nDid you eventually return to a full-time corporate role, or transition into something else?\n\nSeeking advice and shared experiences only — not looking to be flamed. 🙏 Thanks in advance.",

While much of your debt is zero interest, I would still consider paying it down before further bolstering your emergency fund because you don’t want to gamble (pun intended) on your friends’ and family’s goodwill.

If mainstream FI are finally recommending gold, it’s going to get crowded. But to hedge against currency debasement you’ll need gold. Holding just equities is not enough. Because there is a regime change. Understand what the US is trying to do. The US debt  and the interest on their debt is unsustainable. They need to lower interest rates. The fed can cut rates but that will only influence rates on the short end of the bond yield. They can’t control the long end. One idea that’s been floated is to allow the USD to devalue. But devalue against what?  They can allow it to devalue against gold. At the US treasury, gold has a statutory price of $42+. This was set in the 1970s and they have not revalued this. What treasury could do is to revalue gold, mark it to market and suddenly the treasury has “free” money, which they can sell to the Fed. Fed prints the dollars. This is just accounting to give the US treasury new “money”. In addition to this, the Genius act which allow private companies to issue stable coins that are backed by treasuries is a natural buyer of short duration bonds and bills. This helps keep the short term borrowing cost down. But the clarity act allows these stables coins to generate yield. companies like Tether are taking these yields and buying gold. Tether has one of the largest non-nation entity holding gold. Guess what the US government could do? They could ask Tether to back (buy) US long duration treasuries with their gold thus making US treasuries gold-backed. This would massively devalue the US currency but allow them to control yield at the long end, meaning they can borrow at a lower rate. In the end bond holders suffer and a massive transfer of purchasing power go to holders to gold Central banks were already sniffing this eventuality out years ago. Even Singapore has started increasing our gold reserves. 100% equity is not it anymore. That worked well 25-30 years ago. The regime has changed. How you invest must also adapt.",

But there must be a distinction to be made here that the allocation is part of portfolio construction right from the start, instead of having gold allocation just because you want to jump on the hype train. According to the modern portfolio theory, investors are compensated with higher expected returns only by taking on additional systematic risk. However, this total portfolio risk can be optimised by adding uncorrelated asset classes. This allows an investor to reduce overall volatility without necessarily sacrificing the portfolio's expected return. Historically, gold has maintained very low correlation to equities (between 0 to 0.3). This means that gold's price movement is largely independent of the stock market. This improved stability results in better sharpe ratio, signifying higher return per unit of risk taken. In terms of portfolio rebalancing, having a predetermined allocation also allows you to invest in the \"cheaper\" asset. For example, my target allocation for gold in my portfolio is 10%. As of the most recent price movement, my gold allocation has surged to 11%. This allows me to avoid putting more money into gold (since it is overweight and \"expensive\") and channel my incoming funds into the relatively \"cheaper\" equities instead.",
