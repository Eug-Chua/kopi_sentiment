There's zero indication that this was ever anything other than an overly elaborate cosplay. Dude probably just had a midlife crisis and decided to stop giving a shit what others think and start living his best life. This sentence sounds likeit was given just before lunch by a hangry judge. Edit: Also someone below made the valid point that this sentence is comparable to what some drink drivers get, which is idiotic af.",

EDIT: Seeing that my comment is getting some attention I wanted to add a bit more colour here :)  My understanding is that OSTIn was largely ineffective at promoting Singapore's space interests. In fact, when I was actively monitoring space related private sector and regulatory developments between 2020 to 2023, it wasn't OSTIn but SST (https://www.space.org.sg/) , an independent public org that drove much of the progress. My conversations with founders at spacetech companies like Aliena and Equatorial Space suggest that OSTIn was largely invisible and it was SST, DSO, and other IHLs doing a lot of heavy-lifting at the time.

IIRC Equatorial Space charges about S$30,000 / kg, but more mature space launch service companies can quote rates as low as US$8,000/kg.

Funding is just one part of the equation here.  But as mentioned, I definitely support this development as it signals an alignment between the various actors now. \"cube-sats are good PR and training your tech team\" - not sure where this claim is coming from. I guess if you're coming from the angle that Cubesats are largely for demo / proof-of-concept purposes you're not exactly wrong, but NuSpace has proven that Cubesats can have some commercial utility (they're looking at at sensor-to-satellite IoT).",

As expected, there are road closures and motorists are advised to take alternative routes. Our Indian friends have been celebrating Thaipusam for many years already.\n\nI was discussing with a coworker, and he mentioned he was quite relieved that it falls on a Sunday this year, so he doesn’t need to take leave. And it would be nice if everyone could get one more public holiday, since Chinese and Malays already have two religious holidays each.\n\nWhy hasn’t Thaipusam been made a public holiday by now ? When it falls on a weekday, many people take leave anyway, which affects productivity regardless. Wouldn’t it make more sense to just formalise it as a PH ?\n\nAlso, Vesak Day is celebrated by Buddhists, who are mostly Chinese. I'm yet to meet a Indian Buddhist so I’m not entirely sure why Vesak Day is grouped under Indian holiday. Might be there in other countries. Happy to be corrected on this.\n\nAlso there is another festival pongul for Indians which is celebrated for a few days. Atleast give us 1 more PH la.\n\nCurious to hear what others think.\n\nEdit : I understand there are many other Indian communities other than Tamil. Respect that. I want to focus on Thaipusam since it is widely known.\n\nEdit : like someone mentioned I won't be surprised we might get a founder's day before we get another PH for Indians lol.",

This also means we often end up looking a little off-season. Big puffy down jackets in autumn, wearing t-shirts underneath the overcoat, layering like mad to make up for a lack of a good sweater or what. As opposed to local people who have garments that are suited/styled precisely to that weather, so when put next to locals who are very appropriately and fashionably dressed to that weather, we kind of stick out a little. Even in summer, foreigners don't just chiong tshirts/singlets and shorts. Some of the non-tropical countries opt for more sun protection rather than just wearing as little as possible.

Look... \"staying out till late\" and \"going on a solo trip\",are not the same thing. They are definitely \"quite different\". That said, I think your other trips are much more relevant, so focus on those. Consider the differences in those experiences:\n1. Length - were the other trips also of similar length? Every extra day is extra planning to be done.\n2. Destination - are those countries particularly safer? Or, nearer/easier to get to? What are the people typically like? \n3. Activities - did the trips revolve around city areas, or was there often terrain / environmental danger involved? \n4. Emergency plan - in the event of emergency, what's the plan? Who can you call, and who can your parents call? If there's a good difference in any of these questions, then that's probably what they're focused on. Otherwise, if your previous trips are very similar, you can try to drill down on what exactly is it that gives them so much pause. So that’s why I was disappointed that they didn’t trust me enough. It's often not you. As any driver will tell you, the biggest hazard on the road is \"other drivers\". The best driver in the world can still get into an accident as long as there's one other reckless person.

I’m curious how accurate this sounds to locals.\n\nLevel 1: You own a dogHaving a dog in Singapore is expensive. Vaccinations, vets, permits, general upkeep, it all adds up fast. According to them, if you see someone walking a dog, that person is definitely not poor.\n\nLevel 2: You own a carCar ownership is on another level. They said it’s roughly two to three times more expensive than in Dubai. Import duties, insurance, and especially the licence to own a car make it prohibitive. We roughly calculated that a Mercedes E-Class could end up costing around USD 300k.\n\nLevel 3: You have two or more childrenThis was described as the real “wealth tier”. Education is extremely expensive, nannies are costly, and then you add extracurriculars, clubs, activities, camps, and so on. If you’re raising two or more kids in Singapore, you’re doing very well financially.\n\nDoes this way of looking at wealth in Singapore resonate at all, or does it sound off? How would you personally describe the so called levels of wealth?\n\nGenuinely curious to hear local perspectives.",

      "selftext": "Hi all, I have worked in the government job for 10 years, had various stints at statboard and ministries alike. most of the times, I get C or C+, though I never gotten Bs, but I was never the worst performer. Last week, I had been called in for a performance review to be put on PRP.\n\nGranted I am not a stellar performer, but I do my job diligently and try my best. In the first year, I think I was not performing up to standard according to my boss and was asked what are the reasons. I explained that I think there is a job mismatch but I will try my best to learn. However, I find the directions given to me very vague and a lot of times, I just could not nail it. My boss also mentioned that when she hired me, she thought that I am well-versed in handling media. However, I mostly did events  where some were quite high profile and were covered by medias. I guess it is on me that I thought that those were the same as media engagement.\n\nAfter 6 months, I realised that the scope of work is totally off and anything I proposed were just getting shot down. After that, I lost confidence and kept a low profile. I began doing menial tasks, get heavily involved in other department's work. after 1.5 years, I really just cant seem to get the grip of things.\n\nThat said, my bosses were not great, in fact, the entire department were complaining and looking for other job themselves. Naturally, I started the same and was lucky that I scored some interviews. Recently, I have a few second round interviews with other ministries/agencies, and am waiting for official offer.\n\nHowever, last week's performance review came, and they say that my grading will be recorded and it would be shared throughout the entire government record. They indirectly advise me to leave asap but I was adamant to stay for the bonus. We ended with that I will resign when I qualify for my bonus, which when she said to me that my \"bad\" grading would be included and stay in government records forever, and I better secure the offer before its being included as it would affect my future opportunities.\n\nAlso, not to play the blame game, my bosses are getting absolutely pummeled by the senior management team. Our senior management also commented that the middle management (my bosses) are not up to standard, which further validates my view that as much as I am not up to standard, they cannot just pin all the blames on me alone...\n\nLet say in worse case scenario, I get Ds/Es, how screwed am I? Also, I am afraid that once the PRP sets in, HR would inform my potential new hiring agency/ministry that I am currently on PRP and drop me after HR checks... thanks in advance!\n\n*Edit: My bosses also claimed to have provided email coaching, which for the record, I do not receive much. There is not even face to face consultation. When she asked for a piece of work, I would complete it, check through with my colleague (who is supposedly the best performer) and get her green light. But she will come back with not good enough etc. I have recorded and documented our last 3 months email exchanges and I am quite sure not one is a 'coaching' email... Heck, what is 'receiving coaching through emails' anyway???",

Not only that but the overall vibe felt insanely relaxed compared to what I'm used to. Way less honking, if any honking, drivers using turn signals and not flying all over the place, pedestrians were more respectful of each other and people seemed friendlier and less aggressive. In Chicago it's normal for people to use their horn to communicate pretty much anything. Even if they're just annoyed to be sitting in traffic they sometimes will lay on their horn to express that. Or if one person holds up other drivers, seemingly everyone behind them will lay on their horn, and oftentimes yell at them when going past. Also, I heard some people say Singapore is really dense, so I expected it to feel dense. But it didn't feel that dense to me at all. If anything it felt very spacious, green and like you had tons of breathing room everywhere.\n\nThe most recent US city I lived in was Chicago, and compared to Singapore, Chicago feels massive and everything is way closer together. Chicago feels about 4-5x bigger and denser than Singapore in just about every way, and like there's much less room to breathe. So, how does Singapore achieve this? I thought it was lovely.\n\nI'm used to things being this close together everywhere outside of downtown\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/skyscrapers/comments/1icnhl6/chicago_aerial_view/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button",

I think a big difference is that the density peaks far higher in the US. There is a very dense downtown core with almost no residents that quickly spreads out into suburban sprawl. In Singapore, the business and commercial districts are less dense, which makes the densest areas feel more spacious, and conversely there isn't suburban sprawl, so even the most spread out areas feel comparable to or a little denser than an inner suburb like Evanston. It's also in part because Singapore operates more like what one might consider to be far bigger cities, like NYC, in that there are secondary business and commercial districts. I don't know Chicago specifically that well here, but in general in the US I'm used to needing to go downtown a lot. Singaporeans generally don't go to the CBD except to work because things are somewhat spread out around the island into a few other clusters as well. This is somewhat deliberate, as many \"towns\" in Singapore are designed to be somewhat self-contained for daily living. Having trees and parks also goes a long way. This is deliberate policy, without which much of the green space would be \"optimised away\", and everything would feel far denser.",

The situation is much more grim for fresh graduates who is now completing with more experienced professionals who is willing to price themselves lower. I also notice the tone from tech recruiters who give career advise have change and become more pessimistic, from \"Just cold call and tailor your resume, you will land a role within months\" to \"Expect not being able to get in the industry for 1 to 2 years\" i applied even to listings up to a month old and i focused on all tech entry level jobs or jobs not directly tech but accepted tech background, these contribute to the high numbers Is good that you apply for adjacent roles, consider applying for roles that need your skills and capabilities, even if is not an even 50% match from your expectations. Here is what I recommend/suggest: Option A - If you really really want to get into tech: A stellar resume. A lot lecturers and some career consultant give shit advise on resume because they have been out of the force for a quite awhile. Avoid those aesthetics resume, I notice a lot of my SWE pals have \"fun\" looking resumes that are very difficult to read for HR/recruiter, so they end up in the discard pile. See what common phases and keywords that is written in the JDs, try to input those keywords organically and tailor it. Use ChatGPT if you need help but DON'T BLINDLY ACCEPT IT, take a scan, it has tendencies input random achievements. Expand your network via hackathons, voluntary, networking events if someone has a connection in a role you are interested in they can refer you in organisations or give you advise. This also shows you are passionate about the field. I landed in my current role, because I met 2 people in a community event, one of them give me tips on what to say for that company and other is the colleague of the interviewer, so they vouched for me. Upskill yourself, show you are passionate and willing to learn. Explain how such skills/courses make you a more valuable employee. \"I learn x software, which means I can assist and read Y\". As you scan the JDs, keep a lookout on common skills and keywords they used. Continue be open to roles is adjacent to the industry and roles you have the skill for, since you need a foot in. Example, data analytic, Quality Assurance, Business Analytics, IT Support etc. Lastly, I want to acknowledge the feeling and the experience you have is valid, the economy for tech is bad.

One that demonstrates ur understanding of algorithms and if u have the time which u probably do, design a well structured one. One that caters to the user’s interactions (UX and UI) impresses most. It could be an app or site that only has a basic page with a list of products on it or whatever, and a login page. If u dont have any of that, then i think it’s time to brush or pick up some skills… youtube and chatGpt is a good source to develop one. Interviewers would be interested in ur thought process during the creation of the app/site - why did u design it this way? How did u do this login page or how do u authenticate and authorise the users? Is the site/app scalable? What’s the architectural design behind this (mvc, mvvm etc)?

If you need to take public transport, than do short distance trips first. Like 2-3 stops, which would be around a 10 minute train ride. Enough to get them slowly familiar with riding the train and it's a short enough trip that they won't get too overstimulated. Also bring them to more outdoor places, like parks and gardens. It'll be quieter and less crowded than a shopping mall. Plus most parks have a playground area so they can burn off energy and distract themselves with playing. Basically don't rush the process. Instead of doing full day trips with cranky children, do a shorter outing in the morning, go home to rest and nap in the afternoon (so you also avoid the worse of this heat), and then spend the evenings somewhere nearby.

Like the other parent-commenters suggested, do shorter trips. Bring them home to nap (if they are unable to nap in the stroller). Under-5s are really young and have short sleep/eat cycles. Some non-sugar snacks on hand may delay the meltdowns but just don’t push the hunger/tiredness limit. Have had to carry out the screaming toddler to a calmer zone a few times until i noticed this pattern.",

The goal isn’t the meat—it’s using a straw to suck out the rich, buttery bone marrow inside. It’s always served with sliced baguette to mop up the sauce, and it’s virtually impossible to eat without staining your fingers (and shirt) red. ​The Cheat Sheet ​The Vibe: Primal. You eat with your hands and make a mess.\n​The Taste: Like a spicy, savory tomato jam with a deep mutton finish. ​The \"Holy Grail\": The gelatinous marrow (the \"shake and tap\" or \"straw\" method). ​Pro Tip: Wear a black shirt. The red stain is permanent.\n​Where to go (The \"Big Three\"): ​Haji Kadir (Golden Mile): The OG. They claim to have invented it in the 50s.\n​Deen Tiga Rasa (Golden Mile): Known for a slightly more complex, \"three-flavor\" sauce.\n​M.A. Deen Biasa (Jalan Sultan): The \"King of Soup Tulang,\" popular for late-night supper.\n​Would you like me to map out a \"Mamak Route\" for you in the Beach Road/Golden Mile area?",

We had to attend weekly meetings, which was often hosted by Melvin Lim, and got paid $800 per month as mentioned by the redditor who disclosed everyone’s salaries. Late fee of $10 applicable to interns as well if late for meetings, money requested by events team which goes to pantry supplies. The best thing from this scandal is Marc filling in as Interim CEO. He was a genuinely nice person who gave good feedback and listened to our presentations when our mentor would be sick/apply for leave on our presentation days. Can’t say the same for anyone else there though. Could tell that Carrie the HR person didn’t like interacting with interns as well\n\n(edit: adding on that every week required by mentor to interview 2 agents on their closed cases which was ridiculously hard since theyre too busy to show up/will ghost u online, have to text like 30 of them for example at once to get 2 to reply to u within that wee…waste of time since all information is already recorded previously)",

Matthew 5:38-42 However, the actual interpretation of this verse is to say that the punishment is to be proportional to the crime, rather than an ever-escalating cycle of revenge.

      "selftext": "Lowkey was hesitating to post this here but after seeing all the tea about the ppty scandal i realized i’m basically living a version of that nightmare.\n\ni’m a young recent fresh grad (F), worked at this boutique marketing agency near Marina One for about 8 months. Most on the outside thinks the office is so vibey and family culture because my boss (Early 40s M, married) is always posting those cringey hustle quotes and team bonding reels on IG. But behind the scenes? it’s actually a pretext for spending extra time to flirt with young ladies.\n\nBecause i’m \"TikTok-pretty\" (his words not mine), I was shoved into every client meeting and networking dinner since day 1. At first, i thought i had pretty privilege and was getting ahead but i realized quickly i was just there as office decor. My manager has been mentoring me by sending me late night tele messages asking about my career goals and inviting me for 1-on-1 drinks at 10 PM. When i started making excuses to not go, my workload suddenly became impossible and he even CC-ed HR on a tiny typo just to warn me.\n\nBut what really hurts is the senior women in the office, instead of helping me, i heard them in the pantry calling me a diversity hire and saying i only got the job because of my pretty face. Nobody stood up for me even when a guy is clearly being a creep.\n\nSeeing the ppty scandal news about the cheating and toxic power dynamics made me feel physically sick. it’s the same thing, these male leaders using their status to groom fresh grads who don't know any better.  The family branding is just a cover for them to act like they own us. The final straw was last Friday when he told me i should dress more cute an feminine for a pitch because the client likes that aesthetic.\n\ni’m going to tender next week as i so tired of being treated like a pretty trophy. If your office feels like a high-SES cult and the boss is too chummy, please just run. it’s not worth your mental health.",

You're most likely not the first who have been put in such a position, and they probably have also watched and gossiped about previous ones without trying to help in any way. They're probably also salty about not being the chosen ones despite being of the same gender. You don't have to feel bad or hurt about not having any support there at all.

I worked in SMEs twice in my career, and both times I resigned within 3 months. Honestly, I’m surprised you even lasted 8 months. In many SMEs, the company exists to feed the founder’s ego, not to build systems or people. Decisions change based on mood. Feedback depends on whether you stroked the boss’s ego that day. They want people to call them “boss,” expect blind obedience, and confuse authority with leadership. From a career perspective, SMEs are bad for marketing your profile. They usually have no budget, so whatever ideas you have are severely limited. You can be creative all you want, but without resources, you’re stuck doing small, low-impact work that doesn’t showcase real capability. My suggestion is take mnc even pay is low work for 1 year than move to another mnc. Taking contract is also ok rather than sme. Secondly, SMEs are scrutinized by MNCs and top firms. The longer you stay in an SME, the harder it is to move out. It’s always easier to go from MNC → SME, but much harder the other way around. The only SMEs worth considering are well-funded startups with strong backing, like Grab or Carousell in their early days with serious angel investors. Lastly, HR in most SMEs is basically a one-person show, often reporting directly to the boss. Policies are flexible when it benefits management and rigid when it doesn’t. In MNCs, contracts are legally tight, rules are clear, and you have mandatory compliance training on harassment, ethics, and reporting. Means they have these point that I already pass what define as harassment so we all guys cannot act blur say we dont know when we cross the line. I",

For example: Some girls like good-looking guys because appearance gives them social status, confidence, or validation. Some guys like nurturing or emotionally stable girls because they lack emotional safety in their own lives. Some people prefer funny partners because laughter helps them escape stress or insecurity. Some choose ambitious partners because they themselves feel stuck and want direction or motivation. This is also why many “good” girls or “good” guys get ghosted or stay single. It’s usually not because they’re bad people. It’s because they don’t stand out. They don’t have a strong, visible trait that makes someone want them over other options. From my point you might not know what m or o is thinking about. M could be oh i can get to sleep with a young girl. It boost my own confident that I can attract young girl. To g is m have money and power that I like. O can be i like g because she smart and have money. G can be I like o cause he take care of me and is caring.

Focus is on income, as opposed to capital growth, and on liquidity.\n\nSpoke to a RM from one of the major banks here a few months ago who, knowing what I was looking for, pushed me to sign up to a ILP on the whole amount, with no liquidity, no monthly returns and high surrender fees.

Rather, I am looking for passive low risk income such as the above, with liquidity.

Or at least it isn’t a complete waste of money compared to if you had less. IFAs are often not fee-based, they just sell multiple insurance company products and earn commission, so make sure you don’t use this type. Endowus is a very decent mix of user-friendly with acceptable fees. IBKR is cheapest for many things (including Pimco GIS Income Fund) but not so easy to use. The Pimco GIS Income Fund is a ”bond-focus fund”. The bonds inside are a bit more risky and somehow they use some leverage, so the payouts are higher. There are slightly different “flavours” as well, like Pimco GIS Diversified Income Fund. Money market fund is very safe, but the returns are under 1.5% p.a. now so it won’t help you meet your goal of ~5% p.a. in “dividends”. And don’t get tricked into USD mmf with higher interest because the FX risk will just get you instead. Other products that I think could help you are 1) Allianz Income and Growth (can get thru Endowus for lower fees). This is about 1/3 US equities and 2/3 bonds, but the bonds are the riskier type and half perform more like equities. Read this for a more thorough explanation of pros and cons: https://investmentmoats.com/fund/allianz-income-growth-good-returns-for-past-3-years-sustain-7-income-yield/ 2) Amova Singapore Dividend Equity Fund (can’t  buy directly from Endowus, but you can buy from Poems or Dollardex then transfer to Endowus, and Endowus will let you buy more after that).  This is composed of Singapore stocks and gives out 5% p.a. dividends monthly while doing a pretty good job of maintaining or growing capital. A bit less bank-heavy than the Straits Times Index, and you pay higher fees but they solve the monthly payout problem for you. S-REITs also inside, so it’s good for “dummies”. People will probably tell you to invest in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for the lowest fees, but then you need to sell to create your “dividend”, and it requires more financial literacy.

Yield is high for all classes but is also because it doesn't take into account hedging cost. USDSGD hedging cost now, with how volatile the USD is, probably is >2% p.a., this will come out of your NAV. On yields, well lots of nations now are looking at USD in a different light, even if they do have more rate cuts it's likely the yields won't move much at all, hence it's duration position won't offer much upside. Long story short, NAV likely to erode, your 6% dividend net of fees and hedging cost, is typically closer to 3%, assuming spreads stay tight and yields are constant On AIG the dividend yield stated is not an organic yield. The organic yield of the fund is closer to 2+ 3%, due to its mix of HY bonds, convertibles and equities that are ALL US centric.

My income is very fluid - some months under $2k, other months $5k or more (Background: I manage marketing projects). Ad-hoc expenses drain my income quickly.

Yours is “icdiv” and there is another “irc”. https://www.ifastgm.com.sg/igm/admin/buy/highlight/highlightJPM139.pdf Dividends paid by “(irc)” share classes are further adjusted, up or down for, respectively, an estimated positive or negative interest rate carry.\nDividends paid by “(icdiv)” share classes are expected to include a distribution from\ncapital as well as the gains of the Share Class. It sets a predetermined percentage\nrate that is not linked to income or capital gains. During periods of negative performance, the dividend will normally continue to be paid and the value of the investment may fall more rapidly. The overall returns of the two versions are the same (can see on your FSM), but the “irc” dividend yield is only 6+%, while the NAV went up 5%. So I think the “real” dividend is 6%, and when the bond prices went up, your version “icdiv” gave out that gain as extra dividends to maintain the price.

Cons: not exactly tracking the \"main brand\" indices so future performance may vary. Just launched (2024), low volume and shorter track record. Note: EUR, not in USD according to what I found. So idk how it might work with IBKR, I assume no change but im not 100% sure. fwra: Pros: VWRA but cheaper + instead of Vanguard, its invesco. Cons: low volume, relatively new as well. vwra: Pros: high liquidity, broader than ACWD in terms of \"coverage\", vanguard is a giant and staple company for investments. Cons: higher TER, no exposure to small caps. acwd Pros: lower cost than VWRA and still covers decent coverage. Cons: not as much coverage as VWRA. lower volume. imid Pros: has large; medium; and small caps. Similar TER than the rest given the \"coverage\" in markets. Cons: low volume, sampling risk (they dont buy ALL the stocks but a sample instead), and exposure to small caps means higher volatility. IMID might be worth to look to get \"everything\" but if you want cost efficiency for similar coverage to vwra, ACWD / WEBN might be good.

If you want more small cap exposure there's some offerings by DFA(Dimensional Fund Advisors), but you really should understand that its an actively managed ETF that's not just market cap weighted ETF. Therefore the TER for DFA is higher. DFA to me is super interesting, but you have to know they haven't beat the market in the last few years because the large cap US stocks have performed so well in the last few cycles. By the way that they do their fund, it will increase the exposure to small cap stocks, value stocks. They also recently launched Irish docimiled ETFs. They actively use finance research, and their funds are designed to beat the market, which prior to the tech rally, they do beat vanguard's funds and sometimes do beat the market. I am not paid in anyway by those funds or youtube videos, just like you are curious what others think. I'm personally leaning to SWRD+EIMI just for the time being as DFA irish funds are super new aka low liquidity. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfknibBat2A https://www.dimensional.com/us-en/etfs",

While he’s from Tennessee and speaks mainly to an American audience, many of his concepts are quite universal. For starters, if you haven’t already done so, do what you can to get to a $1000 emergency fund. This is the bare minimum to tide you through dire times (illness/injury, job loss, unexpected expense) on a bare bones budget. Then the next step would be to pay down your debt. While much of your debt is zero interest, I would still consider paying it down before further bolstering your emergency fund because you don’t want to gamble (pun intended) on your friends’ and family’s goodwill. After that you can start bolstering your emergency fund to about 3-6 months of expenses. Post back after you’ve completed these steps. Wishing you success in your journey.",
