I do think our public transport infrastructure is starting to lag behind. I doubt we can add more train tracks to current stations, so we should be considering express train services and skip-stops— Punggol coast &gt; Serangoon &gt; Dhoby ghaut &gt; Harbourfront for NE line. This helps people get to their destinations faster. There are some express buses that do this already, so why can’t we introduce this idea to the MRT? \n\nThe analogy between mall and country, while interesting, is a false equivalence imo. Malls and stores operate on a strict commercial logic, while countries have a lot more factors in the equation. Good attempt tho!",

In fact, when I was actively monitoring space related private sector and regulatory developments between 2020 to 2023, it wasn't OSTIn but SST (https://www.space.org.sg/) , an independent public org that drove much of the progress. My conversations with founders at spacetech companies like Aliena and Equatorial Space suggest that OSTIn was largely invisible and it was SST, DSO, and other IHLs doing a lot of heavy-lifting at the time. Happy to hear if anyone else has a different take!~~\n\nEDIT #2: I wish to apologise to readers of this thread for painting what is arguably a biased and incomplete take on OSTIn.

How can that be for \"average family\"?\n\nSo I went to the linked [LCA study](https://www.nea.gov.sg/docs/default-source/media-files/news-releases-docs/cos-2018-media-factsheet-for-lca-study-findings-updated.pdf) to get more information:\n\nAnnex A, Paragraph 1:\n\n&gt;For this study, the functional unit was the volume of items a family of four would approximately buy over the course of one year. The functional unit is needed to determine how many of each type of bag are needed to carry the items. The study found that the functional use of 10 reusable bags (non-woven polypropylene or nylon bags) over a year is equivalent to the use of 1,248 plastic or degradable bags, or 520 paper bags. \\[...\\]\n\n&gt;(Under the photos)  \nThe study assumed that a family buys 50 items per week. The 50 items were placed in the different types of bags studied to determine how many of each type of bag were needed to carry the 50 items.\n\nThe study doesn't say that 1,248 plastic bags are used in a year, just that 1 reusable bag provides 125 plastic bag worth of use. Because If they did use 1,248 plastic bags a year, or 24 bags per week, for the assumed 50 items bought per week, then this family is putting 2-3 items in each plastic bag? What?\n\nAdditionally, the study \"assumed\" a family - that's not the \"average family\", neither is that \"on average\". That's just a hypothetical family.\n\nNEA's read on the study is completely bonkers. And even if they were right, if the average family does indeed use 24 bags per weekly visit, it means they'll now have to bring 24 disposable bags for that one visit - who the heck brings 24 disposable bag.\n\nIf I weren't 3 years late, I'd have written in to NEA.\n\nHello news outlets, here's a story for you.",

As expected, there are road closures and motorists are advised to take alternative routes. Our Indian friends have been celebrating Thaipusam for many years already.\n\nI was discussing with a coworker, and he mentioned he was quite relieved that it falls on a Sunday this year, so he doesn’t need to take leave. And it would be nice if everyone could get one more public holiday, since Chinese and Malays already have two religious holidays each.\n\nWhy hasn’t Thaipusam been made a public holiday by now ? When it falls on a weekday, many people take leave anyway, which affects productivity regardless. Wouldn’t it make more sense to just formalise it as a PH ?\n\nAlso, Vesak Day is celebrated by Buddhists, who are mostly Chinese. I'm yet to meet a Indian Buddhist so I’m not entirely sure why Vesak Day is grouped under Indian holiday. Might be there in other countries. Happy to be corrected on this.\n\nAlso there is another festival pongul for Indians which is celebrated for a few days. Atleast give us 1 more PH la. \n\nCurious to hear what others think.\n\nEdit : I understand there are many other Indian communities other than Tamil. Respect that. I want to focus on Thaipusam since it is widely known. \n\nEdit : like someone mentioned I won't be surprised we might get a founder's day before we get another PH for Indians lol. ",

The current configuration of public holidays in Singapore has been in place since 1968. At the time, faced with the British withdrawal and the need to compete in global markets, the Government decided to reduce the number of public holidays.\n2. The Government conducted consultations with the various religious groups and reached a consensus on which religious festival should be gazetted as a public holiday. Difficult compromises were made as religious groups had to give up observing some of their significant festivals as public holidays. Muslims chose to give up Prophet Muhammad’s Birthday as well as an extra day for Hari Raya Puasa. Christians chose to give up the Saturday after Good Friday and Easter Monday. Hindus had to choose between Thaipusam and Deepavali, and chose the latter. Buddhists, who comprised the largest faith and had only one public holiday to begin with, Vesak Day, were not asked to give it up.\n3. Our calendar of public holidays thus reflects the outcome of these consultations with religious groups. Maintaining this balance has served us well, and it continues to be the sensible approach.",

It is okay to reject being a bridesmaid if you think you dont not have the bandwidth. \n\nAnd depending on how close you are to the bride, like my good friend despite in the midst of divorce she still find the mental strength and bandwidth to be a bridesmaid.

If you like branded  bags/clothes, flashy cars, fine dining, shopping at malls, an education system that trains your kids to be the best academically, then SG is much better than Aus. \n\nAus is good if you value work-life balance, spending time with family, nature, and a relaxed lifestyle. Education is a lot more chill, if your kid wants to be a dancer/ artist/ carpenter and not pursue a uni degree, ppl generally are very supportive. \n\nI think most Aussies I've encountered value their space and time, they can't imagine working the long hours that are the norm for most Singaporeans and living in apartments that are smaller than their living room. Even if they like Singapore as a place to holiday, they can't give those things up easily. \n\nSingaporeans on the other hand, will find it easier to make the move if they like nature and enjoy outdoor activities. It's much easier to move from no car to owning a car, apartment to a big landed house. Workplace culture also is easy to adapt to if you're used to high pressure SG workplaces. Learning the Aussie nuances might take a bit of time, but it's not hard if you go in with an open mind. Finding good SG food is a bit of a problem, but there are plenty of good Malaysian restaurants around. Plus ppl will have a lot more free time now to cook their own favourite dishes with much cheaper and fresher produce. \n\nPerhaps I didn't really answer the question, but just wanted to share that I grew up in SG, moved to Aus in my 30s with my family. I still miss SG a fair bit, my closest friends and family are back there, but my mental health now is way better. My wife and I are spending a lot more time with our children. I will still choose to live in Aus despite making significantly less money than back in SG. I realised making more money is not the answer for everything. SG is still a better place to make money though, so for ppl thinking of moving to Aus, make your money in SG then come over.",

According to them, if you see someone walking a dog, that person is definitely not poor.\n\n**Level 2: You own a car**  \nCar ownership is on another level. They said it’s roughly two to three times more expensive than in Dubai. Import duties, insurance, and especially the licence to own a car make it prohibitive. We roughly calculated that a Mercedes E-Class could end up costing around USD 300k.\n\n**Level 3: You have two or more children**  \nThis was described as the real “wealth tier”. Education is extremely expensive, nannies are costly, and then you add extracurriculars, clubs, activities, camps, and so on. If you’re raising two or more kids in Singapore, you’re doing very well financially.\n\nDoes this way of looking at wealth in Singapore resonate at all, or does it sound off?

Is he rich or just really silly trying to keep up appearances?\n\nThere are indeed levels to wealth but the indicators aren’t very accurate because different people in Singapore have differing needs. Some live simply and others want the luxury lifestyle.\n\nSome have more money than they need for their lifestyle and I wouldn’t call them wealthy or rich. Others have to struggle to live the lifestyle that they want and they’re also not rich. \n\nWealthy to me is when everything in your house is there for a reason and that item is in tip top condition regardless of age. You have the means to keep your household and belongings in good shape without breaking a sweat financially. I.e. no issues maintaining your car or household appliances or clothes etc. \n\nRich is when you’ve passed ‘wealthy’ above and what you want is also what you have and have no need for more and yet you have no need to work for it and your net worth is still heading upwards. You’re well above the average net worth in Singapore and you… don’t have to work. You have financial independence that does not require judicious FIRE practices. Your investments are gaining momentum and medical events in your life and your family’s life are a non issue. You no longer need insurance because you had the option to pay out of pocket without buying a policy. \n\nThere are no indicators that are really reliable. I see every day some flashy Merc or Audi or BMW. The couple steps out draped in branded luxury goods and they live in a HDB or condo. Young… likely in their early to mid 30s. There is a distinct possibility that they live with huge debt. \n\nThere is a lot of pressure to look successful in Singapore just like in many places in the world. Not all that glitters is gold.",

But education is fairly expensive for non-citizens as even placing their child in MOE schools is around $12k+ a year. International schools are easily 2x, 3x that annually.\n\nPet ownership as an indicator is a bit of hit and miss. Some lower income folks also have pets, just that they may not spend top dollar for medical care or upkeep.

Their soft/firm/deep fried tofu really dominate the Asian food market. They’re packaged really nicely, keep well and don’t expire for months, and taste fresh and no weird after-taste like most tofu and vegan protein products that are made outside of Asia. \n\nAlso Dodo frozen seafood balls (https://www.aasiamarket.fi/tuote/fried-fish-balls/) are very popular here. They’re a hotpot staple for Asians in Europe, and they taste much better than other competitor’s products.\n\nI think at least these 2 brands are very recognisable for their high quality products here in Europe (and also in US where I used to live), at least among the Chinese people. So it’s really something to be proud of. I don’t think anyone has ever complained about these products. \n\nIn the past, I would also add Maggi and Tiger Beer on the list. But Maggi products overseas are really substandard. It’s bland and taste quite artificial. And I guess it’s not a Singaporean company even though the brand is so well known in Singapore! 😱 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maggi . Also I think Tiger Beer is no longer brewed in Singapore?

The earlier you realise this, and let go of all of these thoughts about comparing yourself to other people, the earlier you will become happier.\n\nSecondly, sorry this might be a bit out of touch but when you can afford it: travel - lots of solo travel to random places fixed me; travelling with friends and making the best memories is also super amazing. Focus on decentering your life away from manchildren. I did a crazy solo interrailing trip around europe, 10/10. Sometimes you just need to leave the place that you associate with painful memories.",

But became middle upper after.\n\n1. Don’t splurge. The temptations to literally throw ur money for ego and pride is a killer. Whatever you buy has no value except its logo. If you die die want one for looks. Then it’s an insecurity. Parents had this and splurged on unnecessary things.\n\n2. Children payments expenses. Tuition, welfare, maid, etc; understand the need for a helper/maid since parents might be busy. With tuition you can definitely find good ones within a budget means. And more importantly it’s the child’s brain development. Understanding how children learn and associate knowledge to memory and primary motor function would literally have more worth than just throwing things ur child’s way.\n\n3. House mortgage/ car mortgage. Parents once again switch cars when and how they want. From Benz to BMW. And back. General rule of thumb is can you afford it 10x if you can then go for it buddy.\n\n4. Money decisions. What my parents didn’t consider was growth factor and change in business climate. So they don’t have backend extra cash to tide over rough seasons. Or to evolve the business to e-commerce (2015 period) \n\n5. Cash could have went to passive income. There’s good debt and bad debt. Good debt helps you earn more money to pay it off. Parents could have laid a portion of cash, while getting a landed or condo to rent it out for extra passive income.\n\n6. Family relations. Family relations sour from the knowledge of money. My father is quite mommas boy. He side with my grandma more than my mom and because of that relationship sour. Relatives knew he operate the business with my mom. And how much they were earning and always gave “opinions” and wanted a slice of the pie. Until it all went crashing down. Please draw boundaries.\n\n7. Over commitment to secondary relatives. This is parents and siblings. Once you have kids and a wife. Your commitment and primary family is them. You start from scratch with morals and principles you want to put into this family. Over commitment to your siblings and parents. Will blind you and put you in a bind financially, slowly affecting your primary family. And making your life difficult.\n\n7b.) your siblings and parents are able to raise themselves unless they’re disabled or ill. If they’re having difficulties or are in a tight patch. Temporary help is fine. However long term commitment when they’re grown adults responsible, it’s just you unable to say no. Parents will have to retire and you will have to give an allowance and help raise them. However you have siblings who do that too. So make sure it’s equal. Or you all come to an agreement. \n\nThis is all my take upvote or downvote. This is my experience growing up in a well to do family who came crashing down into middle SES. I don’t say this to criticise and hate my parents just a very non personal understanding and analysis of behaviors I wouldn’t bring into my family when I start it.

          "text": "I can’t say how true some people’s statements here are, but you should always take them with a pinch of salt. When it comes to salary, anyone can claim they earn this or that.\n\nIn banking, if someone claims they entered using a private degree, are not doing insurance or sales, and are earning 70–80k, most of the time that is pure nonsense — unless you are in FO. Even IB starting pay is not that high for middle- and back-office support roles.\n\nOf course if they are engineering doing coding and developer that one is different story. I saying pure banking and finance back and middle role\n\nHere’s my take: private vs local degree does matter at the start, and it also depends heavily on HR. The past market and today’s market are completely different. In the past, HR did the filtering. If your HR happened to be from the same school or background, they might still present you to the hiring manager. Today, you go through ATS first, then HR — meaning AI filters you before a human even sees your résumé.\n\nI know this because I just left my previous job and applied recently. I was rejected via automated email, but one recruiter later picked up my résumé and presented it directly to the hiring manager and HR. I got called and managed to secure an interview. That’s why past and present cannot be compared. Most of my roles were honestly secured through recruiters referring me in.\n\nI am an overseas graduate. I managed to enter an MNC, then switched industries into banking, jumping every one to two years with pay increments. I even entered a top IB on a short-term contract, and honestly, they paid me quite well for my experience and support role. IB is not easy to enter — even for local university graduates. As contractors, we still had to go through two to three interview rounds, with heavy emphasis on self-learning ability and pressure handling.\n\nAnother thing people underestimate: colleagues matter more than your degree after you enter. If you want to get promoted fast, you need capable juniors who learn quickly, and teammates who actually contribute instead of free-riding. Sometimes promotion happens simply because someone survives longer in the role. That’s how you end up with leaders who don’t really know what they are doing.\n\nThat’s why you must learn to push back. Private degree doesn’t define your ceiling, but you must protect yourself from burnout and unreasonable workload dumping. Some banking environments promote based on seniority, others on skillset. Having experienced IB, local banks, and global brokerages, I can say clearly: different places have very different views on degrees, performance, and promotion.\n\nSo always take Reddit comments — especially salary and career claims. It just how you manage to navigate the company environment that all. I would say choose a good mentor first than depends on what colleague you work with and see how and what type of people the bank promote. If is seniority than having stay in the bank for yrs works. If is skill than continuous study in banking is very important as finance is really very big. Even up to now I am still occasionally doing ibf test and exam.\n\nLast of all degree only matter at start. Getting good colleague and mentor is important. Knowing how to navigate the office environment is even more important",

          "text": "Private uni grad here and here's my story:\n\n\\- After O's, I did my diploma and advanced diploma in an institution located at Queenstown. Stopped after that to go out and work mainly because the institution discontinued one of their degree programmes (which I wanted to take) and recommended the students to take another one which was twice as ex. Finding a decent job was hard with only a private diploma and most of the job offers were usually entry-level + low salary, but no choice, I had to suck it up.\n\n\\- Decided to do something about the situation and went to a different private institute. They recommended this: (1) do a short foundation programme + degree, or (2) a 1 year diploma + degree. I opted for (2) as the price of the foundation programme and the diploma was almost the same (just a few hundred dollars difference). My degree qualification was a combination of human resource and psychology.\n\n\\- After graduation, my degree really did open up doors for me. My first job after graduation was in a very highly specialised HR function in an MNC.\n\n\\- After some years, I decided to branch away from HR and had my first stint in social services (SPED).\n\n\\- Over the years, I have had several other jobs (also had to take a few career breaks to care for my ageing parents) and I have also worked in govt - incidentally, this was also where I managed to climb the ladder and become a manager.\n\n\\- I also did a qualification in career counselling in a local poly, and it helped me secure a senior role in SPED as I have always been passionate about this field. Again, grateful that my degree + post diploma combi helped me to progress in my career.\n\n\\- I am currently pursuing a psychology-related masters at one of the local universities (yes the Big 3). I was very doubtful that my HR-related, non-honours degree would meet the university's entry requirement, so it was a pleasant surprise when I received the acceptance offer.\n\nPublic or private, it ultimately boils down to how you brand and market yourself to employers. I will admit that in the early years of my career, I have been envious of some friends who were also from private institutes who always got the nice cushy jobs while I was stuck in shitty jobs. But it was when I started upgrading myself and levelling up did I realise that I too, am capable of being a desirable candidate to employers. (Tip: ALWAYS TAILOR YOUR RESUME - I have a folder FULL of different formats of resumes! Lol!)\n\nI am sharing all of this information not to toot my own horn, but to let people in similar circumstances as myself know that career success is still possible with a private degree. When I was younger, I had a lot of self doubts and even had moments where I've thought to myself like wth am I doing with my life. It took years of hard work, coursework assignments, late nights (I studied p/t while working f/t) and shitty bosses before things started falling into place and at that time, I didn't even realise it. It was when I went for my interview for the govt job that I realised that the people there were really interested in my unique blend of working experiences, and I ended up getting an offer within two days.\n\nLastly, not everyone's education and career path will be linear; some of us will job hop or pivot to unrelated fields, and this is perfectly normal and alright.. Eventually we will find things that we are passionate about, and even if we don't, we would ultimately find something that we won't mind doing - this is something I learnt in my career counselling course :)",

There’s almost no real “break”, just different kinds of work.\n\nManpower is a constant headache too. Hiring non-local staff is getting harder with all the rules, and locals understandably expect higher pay because living costs here are no joke. We really want to pay more and hire more locals, but our margins are already super thin. Rent keeps going up. Supplier prices keep increasing. Utilities, ingredients, packaging, wages, everything has gone up.\n\nThen there’s the customer side. Most are nice, and we’re very grateful. But sometimes we meet really unreasonable people who treat us like we owe them something. It can be quite disheartening. Some days we just look at each other and wonder… is it even worth continuing?\n\nWhenever we adjust prices to keep up with rising costs, there will definitely be complaints. But the truth is, we’re always trying to balance being affordable with simply surviving. We can’t compete with big chains and multinational brands that have scale, systems, and pricing power that us small local businesses just don’t have.\n\nWe’re always thankful for every bit of support, but there’s this constant worry about whether its sustainable.

What I expect here is great food, pricing that doesn’t feel exploitative, and service that’s at least a 4+/5. Minor service hiccups are fine. At least two out of the four dishes we order should be exceptional. One place that executes this well is Dumpling Darlings.\n\n**3. Nostalgia places**  \nThese are legacy businesses or places known for classic dishes. My expectations here are lower in some ways. I forgive bad service because I know how hard it is to keep these places running. I even forgive price hikes, as long as they aren’t astronomical. But the food must taste the same as it always did. The day my soon kueh place or laksa stall starts cutting corners, I stop going. I understand there will always be some variability due to sourcing or preparation, but it needs to be good at least four out of five times. There are many great examples of this category—my top spot is Joo Siah BKT at Chinese Garden, which I visit religiously. That said, I’ve stopped going to many places because it’s obvious they no longer maintain quality.\n\n**4. Milestone places**  \nThese are for big moments—birthdays with a zero in them, important anniversaries, reunions—events where the food becomes part of the memory. Here, I expect near-flawless execution. I don’t want a single variable I need to worry about. Prices can be high, but they must be earned. Most dishes should be excellent, and ideally, memorable.\n\nAcross all categories, there’s one non-negotiable: the food should actually be cooked. I’ve encountered too many places where food is centrally prepared by a vendor and the restaurant is essentially a glorified microwave.

The move has disrupted their routines and they have thrown the biggest tantrums I have ever seen almost on a daily basis since we arrived a few weeks ago. This is not how they behaved back in the states. Most of the time it is at home, but sometimes one will suddenly have a nuclear meltdown on the train platform or out to eat. Then I have to get them home as quickly as possible while they are screaming at the top of their lungs the whole way.\n\nFirst of all, I'm really sorry for this. \n\nSecondly, I really want to know how people navigate issues like this when you are constantly surrounded by people that have to suffer from your kid's outbursts. We've mostly gotten sympathetic smiles or at worst confused glances, but it is so embarrassing that I don't want to take my kids out anywhere to experience your amazing country.",

Like 2-3 stops, which would be around a 10 minute train ride. Enough to get them slowly familiar with riding the train and it's a short enough trip that they won't get too overstimulated.\n\nAlso bring them to more outdoor places, like parks and gardens. It'll be quieter and less crowded than a shopping mall. Plus most parks have a playground area so they can burn off energy and distract themselves with playing.\n\nBasically don't rush the process. Instead of doing full day trips with cranky children, do a shorter outing in the morning, go home to rest and nap in the afternoon (so you also avoid the worse of this heat), and then spend the evenings somewhere nearby.

If I had known what it’d be like I would’ve passed on the scholarship and gone to local U happily\n\nMicromanaging bosses, meaningless paper pushing work, bizarre SOPs and internal office initiatives are bad enough. Realizing that I’m not developing any skills and that I will be so irrelevant to any decent company outside govt/SG after my bond is another thing entirely. I believe in helping the public and volunteer extensively outside in my local CC, so I came into the job a year ago with lots of enthusiasm but now I feel completely dead inside. I sense that my leaders + bosses + colleagues are mostly very uninspirational and do not care about excellence or actually creating impactful outcomes at work - they’re happy to show up and skate by on the bare minimum. Comparing this to NS in the army (which is also a govt organisation): at least I genuinely respected some of my NS regulars who were really damn good at certain aspects of their intense job. I can’t say the same about ANYONE where I work.\n\nWhile abroad, I interned at pretty good MNCs and had return offers, but of course I couldn’t take them due to the bond. Saw all my friends go on to earn big bucks but more importantly, open up way more doors for their future career trajectory by starting their career in coveted roles. Despite being initially promised exciting exposure to policy and shaping national strategies when I signed the scholarship, I’m now working in ultra-generalist menial roles that I genuinely think a secondary school kid could do. Feel like I was sold lies coming out of JC as I haven’t used my brain since joining or learnt a single useful thing that’d give me any leverage in the job market if I wanted to leave. The other scholars around and above me are all either resigned to their fate, or also horrendously unhappy. Why did the govt pay $500k for each of us to come back and rot?\n\nI feel like I’ve been pushed and pushed myself my whole life to excel ambitiously. But in govt, there’s hardly a no point (or benchmark) for achieving excellence because my work is so slow and detached from driving real outcomes, and the bonus structure doesn’t give me any real incentive to do so. This would be a great job if all I wanted to do was lepak and collect the steady paycheck but I feel like I am just wasting my life.\n\nI have actually made some money trading stocks and I am in a position to break my bond soon, am recruiting very heavily to get out of it which provides some solace. But man does it make me sad to realise how much time I wasted, and how the system here is wasting their human capital investments.\n\nAlmost every overseas scholar I’ve met across agencies and through friends hates their life and shares similar sentiments. Especially those that made the most of their experience abroad and didn’t just stay to the SG bubble.\n\nThe people at the top need to seriously re-examine how they develop talent or even hand out these scholarships - the current system is a product of a bygone era and sticking to it just will create a massive adverse selection problem for our country’s future. When your ‘brightest’ and most dynamic people come back to sub par opportunities, they’re gonna leave or break their bond ASAP. The yes men are predominantly the ones that stay in govt and rise up to become our future leaders and politicians. It’s very insular, and maybe this is why most new policies that come out of the government these days (especially related to job creation and upskilling) feels backward looking, behind the curve, and attempting to address problems from a highly detached position.\n\nAll I can say is, my exit interview will be glorious. Feel free to ask me anything, not like I’m doing anything important at work",

Not all, mind you, but it's quite a common complaint, and what I am guessing is that there is a disconnect between what you expect and what reality is.\n\nBecause you are a scholar, you likely expect to hit the ground running and given opportunities to show your capabilities. Good or bad, this isn't how public sector works. It is slow, methodical, by the books, and unlikely to challenge you the way you expect or desire to be challenged. \n\nThis was always going to be the gamble when taking up the offer, but this is no different from the private industry. If you get bonded, you have no idea if you're going to be in a place that's going to make good use of you and where you may learn something, or whether you get wasted and learn too little.\n\nYou're in year one. Why not give it a fair shake with an open mind.

Made me a *lot* more marketable in very specialised fields of work and that's how I ended up where I am now.

I’m in my 30s, and I feel like the weight of my parents' lives is falling entirely on me.\n\n**The Background:** My parents are in their mid-70s. My dad stopped working 20+ years ago. Since he stopped working, he has done zero housework and has no social life. He just sits at home watching TV all day, everyday, my mom went out to work instead. My mom (primary school ed, cannot speak English) is a back to being a full-time housewife who caters to his every whim—even pulling the window blinds for him while he sits right next to them since 8 years ago. \n\n**The Current Situation:** Dad is currently hospitalized and officially diagnosed with Dementia. He’s physically mobile, but he constantly \"cries wolf\"—insisting he’s dying and needs the A&amp;E, or demanding to go to the bank because he’s paranoid the government is stealing his money.\n\nI’ve already spoken to the Medical Social Worker and have an AIC referral for respite care. However, I am hitting a brick wall with my mother:\n\n* I’m setting up sensors, emergency alarms, and cameras for safety.\n* I bought a portable wheelchair for emergencies; Mom complained he \"won't like it.\"\n* Every time I suggest a plan, she shuts it down with *\"He won't want.\"*\n\nThe reality is that while they are physically independent, they are \"logistically helpless.\" They cannot handle admin work, bills, or medical appointments. If I’m not there to manage their lives, everything collapses. Yet, my mom tells me I cannot go overseas or go out too much because she can’t cope alone—while simultaneously fighting every support system (daycare/respite) I try to put in place.\n\n**The Internal Struggle:** I know my mom is enabling him. Honestly, if I were \"less Asian,\" I would have walked away years ago. He didn’t provide for me, he took my money, and now I’m spending my 30s being his personal administrator and 24/7 \"on-call\" crisis manager.\n\n**I need advice on:**\n\n1. **Breaking the \"He won't want\" loop:** How do you convince an uneducated, traditional mother that safety and logistics trump the \"boss's\" preferences?\n2. **Managing the \"Cry Wolf\" hospital trips:** How do you handle the constant demands for GP/A&amp;E trips driven by dementia paranoia or fear of death? Ironically he doesn't follow doctor's instructions upon returning home.\n3. **Boundary setting:** How do you reclaim even a small part of your life (like a short trip) when you're being guilt-tripped into staying?\n\nHas anyone else been the \"only functional adult\" in a household like this? How do you survive this without losing your mind?\n\nThank you!\n\n  \n",

Ive amassed $150K at 22 years old if I recall. \nIve done well in my uni, career and have taken on many govt programs, exchange programs and travelled to 30+ countries. Im now waiting to buy a house with my partner and ready to start a family, with furkids as well, in the meantime working on my start up.  \n\nMy family is VERY eerily similar to yours, almost exactly the same. But for me, I spotted the red flags very early on. I was 16 when I noticed all these toxic traits and I knew as an only child, I had no siblings to rely on and my only escape was either death or education. \n\nI worked minimum 3 jobs at any one time. Some were odd jobs, some were more consistent. I was a waiter, a cashier, a UAT tester, giving surveys etc. I did so many things but I honestly had SO MUCH fun working, made some friends along the way too. \n\nI also learnt time management - this was crucial because I knew I had to leave my toxic household. I needed to play the long game. \n\nSo whilst doing all these, I moved out at around 17? I rented all kinds of homes, its actually good to rent because I knew what type of landlords there are and learnt what kind of house I want in the future. E.g. a room I rented had a built-in furniture that blocked the door (???) Im definitely clocking that. \n\nIt was messy, tiring, gruesome as a low income kid but I knew I had one life and I am NOT going to be constrained and serving my time to 2 useless adults. I much rather do actual charity to people who needed it (which I did). \n\nThere is NOTHING guilty about leaving them. I took every opportunity to leave (exchange programs, work travel, part time jobs, midnight study sessions). Please LEAVE soon or slowly, if not a fight or some form of violence or your breaking point will erupt and something worse will transpire. \n\nPeople often show their worst sides to us, yet we choose not to see it. If you feel the need for filial piety, justify it elsewhere. For me, I give back to other family, relatives that have taken great care of me.  \n\nBest of luck and feel free reach out to me if you need any tips on therapy welfare, time management, side hustles, housing lifehacks, volunteering opportunities, govt exchange programs, startups, jobs, amassing 6 figures quickly or just someone to talk to!",

Second, inflation rate is not actually equal for everyone.\n\nFor the first point, you might need to relook at whether 1.3m in 2036 (11 years from now) is actually enough. For the second point, you will need to see what you are actually spending on.\n\nIf you envision owning a car, multiple properties and frequent visits to hospital, those are things that are inflating at a very high rate in Singapore. So, inflation rate will be high.\n\nIf you envision taking public transport, eating more hawker and having a relatively healthy life, inflation is not as high.\n\nAnother thing people ignore is CPF. CPF is a bond-like instrument. Whether you like it or not, 37% of your income goes there so remember to factor it in.\n\nAssuming you have hit FRS, all excess above FRS can be taken out from 55 onwards.\n\nThis means from 55 onwards, the interest from OA of 2.5% is perpetually available for you to take out and amount never goes down as long as you only take out the interest.\n\nFrom 65 onwards, CPF pays out around 6% of your RA annually. This means it is like a 6% perpetual bond (note it does eat into the RA amount but otherwise, it functions just like a perpetual bond).\n\nSo in reality, you don't actually need as much to retire, provided you are ok to see your cash-funded assets go down before 55 before being supplemented later by cashflow from CPF.\n\nIt does make calculations much more complicated but those are things that are usually ignored for a simpler 4%SWR.\n\nAlso, the 4% SWR is already inflation-adjusted. Some people miss this point and even the researcher who came up with it says that people can actually draw up to 4+% (can't remember exact % but I guess you already know this) because again, another point people ignore is that in retirement, you usually spend less. No more travels, no more funding of kids' education, no more mortgages, etc.\n\nThat said, the SWR is meant for a 30-year retirement based on the research. So nobody knows how it performs for longer period but in theory, you can just reduce the SWR for higher success or start with more.\n\nIn any case, it is always good to err on side of caution but do also note that there are many people who retire on less than this amount TODAY in Singapore, granted the lifestyle will not be a glamorous 1.\n\nI suggest you first calculate the present value of 1.3m in 2036 then see if it meets what you feel would be enough today.",

I’m thankful that I’ve not faced unemployment — I always had another offer lined up before tendering, typically taking a short 1–2 month break between roles, clearing my ALs for self love.\n\nOver the past few months though, I’ve been feeling increasingly drained and unmotivated, with a fair bit of anxiety whenever the next day is a working day. It feels like there’s no clear “end point” to corporate life, unlike schooling where timelines were always defined.\n\nLately, I’ve been seriously considering stepping away from the corporate world after a few more years, perhaps take on a few months OR a year or two of break. Thereafter, possibly to pursue something more flexible (“own time, own target” - unfortunately I don’t have a concrete plan yet). \n\nThe main reason for staying on a few more years in the corporate world would be to build a larger buffer and investment portfolio, ideally one that can cover a good portion (or all) of my monthly expenses via passive income. That way, I feel that I will be less anxious about leaving my job at that point of time.\n\nWould appreciate perspectives from those who’ve done something similar:\n\nBefore leaving, did you aim for a specific portfolio size or expense multiple for peace of mind?\n\nHow old were you when you made the move?\n\nDid you eventually return to a full-time corporate role, or transition into something else?\n\nSeeking advice and shared experiences only — not looking to be flamed. 🙏 Thanks in advance.",

It sets a predetermined percentage\nrate that is not linked to income or capital gains.

I read thru every comment and think through it. Here are some answers that might make the picture clearer.\n\nMy life has changed against my will. Therefore here I am trying to rearrange my life after my soul mate of 25yrs suddenly departs from my life. \n\n*BTO:* \n\n* Have contacted HDB and they have exercise leniency in my case and allow me to keep the BTO. Application has also been changed to reflect my name only. \n* HPS does not work in this case because keys are yet to be collected. \n\n*Why take a loan for the BTO when I can fully paid it off?* \n\n* Original intention was to paid it off once we collect the keys so we don't have to worry about the other party financing the flat alone if one dies. \n* But situation changes now, his OA used +AI will now become cash proceeds when I sell instead of returning to his CPF-OA if he is still alive. I would rather keep the cash proceeds now and generate income from it while paying it slowly. If i happen to die with a loan, my beneficiary can just sell it off. \n\n*6K per month expenses &amp; travel expenses seems high*\n\n* I included cost of owning a car in the future (counting it as 2.5K in the expense for monthly repayments + vehicle expenses) into the predicted expenses. \n* Current expenses is less than 4K (including regularly investments and insurance), not counting one-time off stock purchases.  \n* Travel expenses and trips can always be adjusted, it just a wish to continue to what I used to do.\n\n*Liquid net* *worth, insurance payout, inheritance?*\n\n* No inheritance. Only a fully paid HDB, a fully paid car, CPF &amp; a business. \n* No insurance payout except DPS. He is not insurable, main reason why he wants me saves majority of my income for the future if he is gone. \n* Did not include valuables like gold, watches as I did not intend to sell unless I need the money for survival. (Est\\~300-350k after a haircut of 30% loss if I were to sell it)\n\n*Income:*\n\n* FT job \\~ 100K \n* Side hustle was approx \\~ 60-70K last year. But I project it be to 30K this year as I would just doing the minimum to keep myself relevant in the field.\n* Business \\~ it was my late husband business. Running a business that I am no prior experience in a lot of work and stress. But I would like to keep it going for as long as I can, no intention to just close or sell it even before I try, it was his effort and something he is passionate about but will let go once it becomes not profitable/sustainable. Income is just based of the salary I am current drawing, which is way below what he used to draw. Had to hire more help which thus increase in operating cost.  \n\n*Isn't there a income cap for bto buyers? How u get it in the first place?*\n\n* We applied it during covid years. I got no income from side hustle only FT job. His business was badly hit by covid for more than 2years. He did not draw any salary and sales drop 90%.  ",

While much of your debt is zero interest, I would still consider paying it down before further bolstering your emergency fund because you don’t want to gamble (pun intended) on your friends’ and family’s goodwill.

Both of us are currently working full-time with unstable hours, frequent OT and occasional weekends. We’re staying with parents now but will be moving into our BTO soon, which is far from family support.\n\nDue to childcare constraints (often reaching home past 8pm), I’m considering stepping away from full-time work to be a SAHM after we move out. I’m conscious that this would likely be a one-way decision — I’m in tech and stepping away for several years would make returning extremely challenging.\n\nHusband’s role is more stable and it’s not ideal for him to quit, even though my income is currently higher.\n\nFinancials (Personal Assets):\n\n•\tTotal net worth: \\\\\\~550k\n\n•\tCPF: \\\\\\~230k (BTO payments not started yet)\n\n•\tInvestments: \\\\\\~170k\n\n•\t\\\\\\~60k US/tech stocks\n\n•\t\\\\\\~40k DBS shares\n\n•\tremainder in ILP\n\n•\tCash: \\\\\\~150k\n\nIncome (current):\n\n•\tMe: \\\\\\~110k p.a.\n\n•\tHusband: \\\\\\~80k p.a.\n\nWe’re expecting upcoming expenses for renovation, insurance, and higher household costs once we move out, so I’m cautious about liquidity.\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. Is it financially reasonable to rely on a single income (\\\\\\~80k p.a.) for household expenses in our situation?\n2. How much cash buffer would be prudent given BTO + reno in the near term?\n3. Any advice on managing investments/liquidity to support a single-income phase while preserving long-term financial flexibility?\n\nAppreciate any advice, especially from those who’ve gone through a single-income or SAHM phase.\n\nEdit:\n\nJust to clarify, the financials listed above are my personal assets, not combined household assets.\n\nI understand the feedback that relying on a single income may be challenging.
