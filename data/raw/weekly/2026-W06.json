While walking through the car park near the Chinese temple at Maxwell MRT, I witnessed a traffic accident at around 11:40 a.m. today. It was the first time in my life that I saw a traffic accident happen right in front of me.\n\n&gt;I was the first person walking behind the mother and her daughter. A woman was driving out from the car park. She did not look to the right for pedestrians; she only looked to the left when she turned right. The front wheel of her car ran over the little girl’s abdomen first, then over the mother’s leg. After that, the woman pressed the accelerator hard, and the rear wheel ran over the mother’s abdomen again.\n\n&gt;I don’t know why she accelerated so quickly when she just exited the car park. I guess they might be tourists. I can help as a witness and testify about this traffic accident.\n\n&gt;I clearly saw that when the front wheel ran over them, the driver should have felt that there was something under the wheel. However, she did not stop to get out of the car to check. Instead, she accelerated strongly and continued to drive forward, which caused the rear wheel to run over the mother’s abdomen again.\n\n&gt;I panicked at that moment and cannot remember clearly whether the rear wheel ran over the little girl again. I was in shock when the incident happened right in front of me.\n\n&gt;At the time of the accident, the husband was not with them. Only the mother and daughter were there, and I was walking behind them. About two minutes later, the husband ran over and hugged the little girl.\n\n&gt;When the front wheel ran over the little girl, she was thrown and rolled about three times and ended up lying face down on the ground. Her mouth was in a pool of blood, next to her water bottle and her camera. The blood was flowing heavily from her mouth and spread thickly on the road.\n\n&gt;When the woman got out of the car and went to the back to check, she then realized that she had caused the accident.

In fact, when I was actively monitoring space related private sector and regulatory developments between 2020 to 2023, it wasn't OSTIn but SST (https://www.space.org.sg/) , an independent public org that drove much of the progress. My conversations with founders at spacetech companies like Aliena and Equatorial Space suggest that OSTIn was largely invisible and it was SST, DSO, and other IHLs doing a lot of heavy-lifting at the time. Happy to hear if anyone else has a different take!~~\n\nEDIT #2: I wish to apologise to readers of this thread for painting what is arguably a biased and incomplete take on OSTIn. I meant no malice and only wanted to share my perspective, but I also understand that what I've written here unfairly damages OSTIn's reputation.",

This was 18 years ago. \n\nFast forward to 2024, my poly friend's wedding, she and her husband are expats. Both are in good stages of their careers, not rich but well to do as career is in good place. They paid for our bridesmaid dresses, bride let us choose from Shein and she bought them for us, meet us for a dinner while she passed us the dress 👗 (she treated us the dinner, while we delegated the bridesmaid work, who takes care of what, who recce the place while joining the bride and groom for menu tasting, who is bridesmaid of honor and so on)\n\nDuring pre wedding decor we all woke up super early (as its a lunch), we did our own makeup and hair, help to decorate the wedding lunch space. Help each other (bridesmaids, there are about 6 of us) with hair and makeup. We bring our own decorations to contribute, like i bought a bubble gun and solution, fairy lights and flower petals, out of my own pocket.\n\nWe bridesmaids also give ang baos for the wedding lunch. It was at Andaz, I gave a $288 angbao, with $2 notes from the flower series (older singapore notes), cause my mum has some old notes. Some bridesmaids who are closer to bride, like a workplace bestie bought her a customised jewellery piece on top of ang bao.\n\nAfter the wedding lunch, we joined the bride and groom and his friends from the country he's from, for a dinner by the fullerton riverside, as a compensation from the bride and groom. Bride and groom gave us a small wedding gift bag, which the bride's sister prepared on their behalf, with a $50 ang bao. \n\nI'm sharing, because i feel everyone's life experiences are different. And at the end of the day, bridesmaid duty is quite heavy, choose wisely who you are a bridesmaid for. It is okay to reject being a bridesmaid if you think you dont not have the bandwidth. \n\nAnd depending on how close you are to the bride, like my good friend despite in the midst of divorce she still find the mental strength and bandwidth to be a bridesmaid. This is because she is very good friend with the bride, and the bride is not chinese, who is not pantang whether a \"divorcee\" will pass the luck to the newlyweds. Like they are such good friends, nothing stands in the way for them celebrate for the bride's union joys. \n\nOP, revisit why you become a bridesmaid moving forward.

Why should they incur extra costs for sth thats not theirs to begin with? And OP did try to help as much as she could alr.\n\nI believe this boils down to the bride not being thoughtful and sensitive enough to make OP feel appreciated, not necessarily because of money entirely.

Everyone gets at least 20 days of leave, with most workplaces giving more depending on your union. \n\nSingapore is great for quite a lot of stuff. If you like branded  bags/clothes, flashy cars, fine dining, shopping at malls, an education system that trains your kids to be the best academically, then SG is much better than Aus. \n\nAus is good if you value work-life balance, spending time with family, nature, and a relaxed lifestyle. Education is a lot more chill, if your kid wants to be a dancer/ artist/ carpenter and not pursue a uni degree, ppl generally are very supportive. \n\nI think most Aussies I've encountered value their space and time, they can't imagine working the long hours that are the norm for most Singaporeans and living in apartments that are smaller than their living room. Even if they like Singapore as a place to holiday, they can't give those things up easily. \n\nSingaporeans on the other hand, will find it easier to make the move if they like nature and enjoy outdoor activities. It's much easier to move from no car to owning a car, apartment to a big landed house. Workplace culture also is easy to adapt to if you're used to high pressure SG workplaces. Learning the Aussie nuances might take a bit of time, but it's not hard if you go in with an open mind. Finding good SG food is a bit of a problem, but there are plenty of good Malaysian restaurants around. Plus ppl will have a lot more free time now to cook their own favourite dishes with much cheaper and fresher produce. \n\nPerhaps I didn't really answer the question, but just wanted to share that I grew up in SG, moved to Aus in my 30s with my family. I still miss SG a fair bit, my closest friends and family are back there, but my mental health now is way better. My wife and I are spending a lot more time with our children. I will still choose to live in Aus despite making significantly less money than back in SG. I realised making more money is not the answer for everything. SG is still a better place to make money though, so for ppl thinking of moving to Aus, make your money in SG then come over.",

If you’re dating to marry, you need to look at everything objectively and long term. How is the guy and his career (does he have goals) , how you guys quarrel (is it in a healthy manner), what is his value in religion and kids, how you guys deal with difficult conversations, what is his financial philosophy (does he not save), etc.. Because it’s not just about feelings anymore. I have a few criteria that the guy has to meet else I’ll drop them, even at the first date. My friends said going on dates with me is like going for an interview. Maybe I got serious fear of divorce, I need to 100% ensure my husband will be the right choice for me. I even went to pre marital course with my husband just for a third party to assess our relationship. \n\nMarrying the right one at a later age is better than marrying the wrong one early. Personally, I look at my own relationship and I feel so blessed to have met the one. I’m glad that I didn’t settle for any Tom, dick or harry. \n\nBto wise…. Husband first. Logistic second. Everything will fall into place nicely once you find a good man, because he will be there with you, through thick or thin. You’ll never feel alone.",

If u cannot pay your mortgage alone means you will have to sell your BTO and move to a rental flat which will feel really damn bad.

You are worthy of love. Don't let anyone tell you that otherwise. You deserve someone that worships the ground you walk on.\n\nI was in this situation as well. I had exes that cheated on me. I too, broke up with one ex due to too many issues. Compatibility wise - he wanted kids, I didn't. I got a job offer in London, and he wanted to stay in SG. He also felt that I gained too much weight - this was when I realised the love was conditional af. And we too, selected our BTO. It was a lot of pain, but luckily the loss was only a few grand, we didn't pay the downpayment yet. In the grand scheme of things, I am glad I dodged a bullet. Because later the down the line, a divorce would be messy and more expensive than a few grand. Rather be happy single than in an unhappy marriage.\n\nWhat worked for me was that I realised that nobody actually gives a fuck about you lol as in no one is caring about whether you look good in front of them or not. Because I have realised that I don't really care much about other people, so I think the same of how other people would see me. The earlier you realise this, and let go of all of these thoughts about comparing yourself to other people, the earlier you will become happier.\n\nSecondly, sorry this might be a bit out of touch but when you can afford it: travel - lots of solo travel to random places fixed me; travelling with friends and making the best memories is also super amazing.

But became middle upper after.\n\n1. Don’t splurge. The temptations to literally throw ur money for ego and pride is a killer. Whatever you buy has no value except its logo. If you die die want one for looks. Then it’s an insecurity. Parents had this and splurged on unnecessary things.\n\n2. Children payments expenses. Tuition, welfare, maid, etc; understand the need for a helper/maid since parents might be busy. With tuition you can definitely find good ones within a budget means. And more importantly it’s the child’s brain development. Understanding how children learn and associate knowledge to memory and primary motor function would literally have more worth than just throwing things ur child’s way.\n\n3. House mortgage/ car mortgage. Parents once again switch cars when and how they want. From Benz to BMW. And back. General rule of thumb is can you afford it 10x if you can then go for it buddy.\n\n4. Money decisions. What my parents didn’t consider was growth factor and change in business climate. So they don’t have backend extra cash to tide over rough seasons. Or to evolve the business to e-commerce (2015 period) \n\n5. Cash could have went to passive income. There’s good debt and bad debt. Good debt helps you earn more money to pay it off. Parents could have laid a portion of cash, while getting a landed or condo to rent it out for extra passive income.\n\n6. Family relations. Family relations sour from the knowledge of money. My father is quite mommas boy. He side with my grandma more than my mom and because of that relationship sour. Relatives knew he operate the business with my mom. And how much they were earning and always gave “opinions” and wanted a slice of the pie. Until it all went crashing down. Please draw boundaries.\n\n7. Over commitment to secondary relatives. This is parents and siblings. Once you have kids and a wife. Your commitment and primary family is them. You start from scratch with morals and principles you want to put into this family. Over commitment to your siblings and parents. Will blind you and put you in a bind financially, slowly affecting your primary family. And making your life difficult.\n\n7b.) your siblings and parents are able to raise themselves unless they’re disabled or ill. If they’re having difficulties or are in a tight patch. Temporary help is fine. However long term commitment when they’re grown adults responsible, it’s just you unable to say no. Parents will have to retire and you will have to give an allowance and help raise them. However you have siblings who do that too. So make sure it’s equal. Or you all come to an agreement. \n\nThis is all my take upvote or downvote. This is my experience growing up in a well to do family who came crashing down into middle SES. I don’t say this to criticise and hate my parents just a very non personal understanding and analysis of behaviors I wouldn’t bring into my family when I start it.

          "text": "I can’t say how true some people’s statements here are, but you should always take them with a pinch of salt. When it comes to salary, anyone can claim they earn this or that.\n\nIn banking, if someone claims they entered using a private degree, are not doing insurance or sales, and are earning 70–80k, most of the time that is pure nonsense — unless you are in FO. Even IB starting pay is not that high for middle- and back-office support roles.\n\nOf course if they are engineering doing coding and developer that one is different story. I saying pure banking and finance back and middle role\n\nHere’s my take: private vs local degree does matter at the start, and it also depends heavily on HR. The past market and today’s market are completely different. In the past, HR did the filtering. If your HR happened to be from the same school or background, they might still present you to the hiring manager. Today, you go through ATS first, then HR — meaning AI filters you before a human even sees your résumé.\n\nI know this because I just left my previous job and applied recently. I was rejected via automated email, but one recruiter later picked up my résumé and presented it directly to the hiring manager and HR. I got called and managed to secure an interview. That’s why past and present cannot be compared. Most of my roles were honestly secured through recruiters referring me in.\n\nI am an overseas graduate. I managed to enter an MNC, then switched industries into banking, jumping every one to two years with pay increments. I even entered a top IB on a short-term contract, and honestly, they paid me quite well for my experience and support role. IB is not easy to enter — even for local university graduates. As contractors, we still had to go through two to three interview rounds, with heavy emphasis on self-learning ability and pressure handling.\n\nAnother thing people underestimate: colleagues matter more than your degree after you enter. If you want to get promoted fast, you need capable juniors who learn quickly, and teammates who actually contribute instead of free-riding. Sometimes promotion happens simply because someone survives longer in the role. That’s how you end up with leaders who don’t really know what they are doing.\n\nThat’s why you must learn to push back. Private degree doesn’t define your ceiling, but you must protect yourself from burnout and unreasonable workload dumping. Some banking environments promote based on seniority, others on skillset. Having experienced IB, local banks, and global brokerages, I can say clearly: different places have very different views on degrees, performance, and promotion.\n\nSo always take Reddit comments — especially salary and career claims. It just how you manage to navigate the company environment that all. I would say choose a good mentor first than depends on what colleague you work with and see how and what type of people the bank promote. If is seniority than having stay in the bank for yrs works. If is skill than continuous study in banking is very important as finance is really very big. Even up to now I am still occasionally doing ibf test and exam.\n\nLast of all degree only matter at start. Getting good colleague and mentor is important. Knowing how to navigate the office environment is even more important",

          "text": "Private uni grad here and here's my story:\n\n\\- After O's, I did my diploma and advanced diploma in an institution located at Queenstown. Stopped after that to go out and work mainly because the institution discontinued one of their degree programmes (which I wanted to take) and recommended the students to take another one which was twice as ex. Finding a decent job was hard with only a private diploma and most of the job offers were usually entry-level + low salary, but no choice, I had to suck it up.\n\n\\- Decided to do something about the situation and went to a different private institute. They recommended this: (1) do a short foundation programme + degree, or (2) a 1 year diploma + degree. I opted for (2) as the price of the foundation programme and the diploma was almost the same (just a few hundred dollars difference). My degree qualification was a combination of human resource and psychology.\n\n\\- After graduation, my degree really did open up doors for me. My first job after graduation was in a very highly specialised HR function in an MNC.\n\n\\- After some years, I decided to branch away from HR and had my first stint in social services (SPED).\n\n\\- Over the years, I have had several other jobs (also had to take a few career breaks to care for my ageing parents) and I have also worked in govt - incidentally, this was also where I managed to climb the ladder and become a manager.\n\n\\- I also did a qualification in career counselling in a local poly, and it helped me secure a senior role in SPED as I have always been passionate about this field. Again, grateful that my degree + post diploma combi helped me to progress in my career.\n\n\\- I am currently pursuing a psychology-related masters at one of the local universities (yes the Big 3). I was very doubtful that my HR-related, non-honours degree would meet the university's entry requirement, so it was a pleasant surprise when I received the acceptance offer.\n\nPublic or private, it ultimately boils down to how you brand and market yourself to employers. I will admit that in the early years of my career, I have been envious of some friends who were also from private institutes who always got the nice cushy jobs while I was stuck in shitty jobs. But it was when I started upgrading myself and levelling up did I realise that I too, am capable of being a desirable candidate to employers. (Tip: ALWAYS TAILOR YOUR RESUME - I have a folder FULL of different formats of resumes! Lol!)\n\nI am sharing all of this information not to toot my own horn, but to let people in similar circumstances as myself know that career success is still possible with a private degree. When I was younger, I had a lot of self doubts and even had moments where I've thought to myself like wth am I doing with my life. It took years of hard work, coursework assignments, late nights (I studied p/t while working f/t) and shitty bosses before things started falling into place and at that time, I didn't even realise it. It was when I went for my interview for the govt job that I realised that the people there were really interested in my unique blend of working experiences, and I ended up getting an offer within two days.\n\nLastly, not everyone's education and career path will be linear; some of us will job hop or pivot to unrelated fields, and this is perfectly normal and alright.. Eventually we will find things that we are passionate about, and even if we don't, we would ultimately find something that we won't mind doing - this is something I learnt in my career counselling course :)",

I used to work corporate, but have taken a step back because it feels like such a waste if no one continues this, and serving local food we are proud of.\n\nWe’re on our feet for hours. And when there are no customers, it doesn’t mean we’re resting, there’s always prep, cleaning, stocking up, paperwork. There’s almost no real “break”, just different kinds of work.\n\nManpower is a constant headache too. Hiring non-local staff is getting harder with all the rules, and locals understandably expect higher pay because living costs here are no joke. We really want to pay more and hire more locals, but our margins are already super thin. Rent keeps going up. Supplier prices keep increasing. Utilities, ingredients, packaging, wages, everything has gone up.\n\nThen there’s the customer side. Most are nice, and we’re very grateful. But sometimes we meet really unreasonable people who treat us like we owe them something. It can be quite disheartening. Some days we just look at each other and wonder… is it even worth continuing?\n\nWhenever we adjust prices to keep up with rising costs, there will definitely be complaints. But the truth is, we’re always trying to balance being affordable with simply surviving. We can’t compete with big chains and multinational brands that have scale, systems, and pricing power that us small local businesses just don’t have.\n\nWe’re always thankful for every bit of support, but there’s this constant worry about whether its sustainable. Behind the scenes, it’s a daily struggle to make the numbers work, while still serving food we’re proud of.\n\nTo those who are patient, who understand that small businesses are run by very tired humans just doing their best, rly thank you 😭\n\nJust curious, what makes you choose to support a local business and when will people be willing to start paying more for local food?

Date-night places**  \nWe usually don’t visit a date-night place more than three times a year. What I expect here is great food, pricing that doesn’t feel exploitative, and service that’s at least a 4+/5. Minor service hiccups are fine. At least two out of the four dishes we order should be exceptional. One place that executes this well is Dumpling Darlings.\n\n**3. Nostalgia places**  \nThese are legacy businesses or places known for classic dishes. My expectations here are lower in some ways. I forgive bad service because I know how hard it is to keep these places running. I even forgive price hikes, as long as they aren’t astronomical. But the food must taste the same as it always did. The day my soon kueh place or laksa stall starts cutting corners, I stop going. I understand there will always be some variability due to sourcing or preparation, but it needs to be good at least four out of five times. There are many great examples of this category—my top spot is Joo Siah BKT at Chinese Garden, which I visit religiously. That said, I’ve stopped going to many places because it’s obvious they no longer maintain quality.\n\n**4. Milestone places**  \nThese are for big moments—birthdays with a zero in them, important anniversaries, reunions—events where the food becomes part of the memory. Here, I expect near-flawless execution. I don’t want a single variable I need to worry about. Prices can be high, but they must be earned. Most dishes should be excellent, and ideally, memorable.\n\nAcross all categories, there’s one non-negotiable: the food should actually be cooked. I’ve encountered too many places where food is centrally prepared by a vendor and the restaurant is essentially a glorified microwave. I hope such places slowly shut down and realize this isn’t acceptable. If I want reheated frozen food, I’ll get it from FairPrice.",

While walking through the car park near the Chinese temple at Maxwell MRT, I witnessed a traffic accident at around 11:40 a.m. today. It was the first time in my life that I saw a traffic accident happen right in front of me.\n\nI was the first person walking behind the mother and her daughter. A woman was driving out from the car park. She did not look to the right for pedestrians; she only looked to the left when she turned right. The front wheel of her car ran over the little girl’s abdomen first, then over the mother’s leg. After that, the woman pressed the accelerator hard, and the rear wheel ran over the mother’s abdomen again.\n\nI don’t know why she accelerated so quickly when she just exited the car park. I guess they might be tourists. I can help as a witness and testify about this traffic accident.\n\nI clearly saw that when the front wheel ran over them, the driver should have felt that there was something under the wheel. However, she did not stop to get out of the car to check. Instead, she accelerated strongly and continued to drive forward, which caused the rear wheel to run over the mother’s abdomen again.\n\nI panicked at that moment and cannot remember clearly whether the rear wheel ran over the little girl again. I was in shock when the incident happened right in front of me.\n\nAt the time of the accident, the husband was not with them. Only the mother and daughter were there, and I was walking behind them. About two minutes later, the husband ran over and hugged the little girl.\n\nWhen the front wheel ran over the little girl, she was thrown and rolled about three times and ended up lying face down on the ground. Her mouth was in a pool of blood, next to her water bottle and her camera. The blood was flowing heavily from her mouth and spread thickly on the road.\n\nWhen the woman got out of the car and went to the back to check, she then realized that she had caused the accident.

He looked super lost and kept waving his hand like he needed help, so i thought ok lor he’s blind and the crossing is quite busy, might as well help.\n\nWhen the light turned green i went over and let him hold my arm, but THE MOMENT i stepped off the kerb he literally wrapped his arm around my waist and squeezed me DAMN tight. i was honestly damn shocked but we were in the middle of the road and there were cars turning, so i just suck it up and thought maybe he’s just scared of falling?\n\nafter we crossed he didn’t let go and started saying his leg very painful and asked if i can help him tie his shoelaces. then he suddenly say he very thirsty and need water. i told him i can run to 7-11 buy one for him but he insisted on having MY water. i felt bad since he’s \"blind\" right so i just took my bottle out and passed to him.\n\nguys... he didn't even pour it into his mouth. he literally put his ENTIRE LIPS all over the rim and drank it like that. i was so grossed out but i just told myself maybe he cannot see where the opening is?\n\nthen i guided him to a bench nearby to tie his laces like he asked. i was wearing a spaghetti top today because the weather is literally warm... so i bent down to reach his shoes. when i looked up to ask if it was tight enough, i caught him STAIRING straight down my top. his eyes were literally focused.\n\ni quickly stood up and said i need to go class already. i walked away quite fast but i looked back after a bit and i saw him UNCLE WAS LITERALLY SCROLLING HIS PHONE AND WALKING WITH NO CANE NO NOTHING.\n\ni feel so stupid and violated and thought i was doing a good deed but i think i just got played by a creep.

      "selftext": "I studied in the UK/US at a great uni and am currently serving my 6 year bond. My work thus far in the public service for an economic related Ministry/Statboard has been so bad and I honestly preferred my time serving NS in my chiong sua combat unit…. If I had known what it’d be like I would’ve passed on the scholarship and gone to local U happily\n\nMicromanaging bosses, meaningless paper pushing work, bizarre SOPs and internal office initiatives are bad enough. Realizing that I’m not developing any skills and that I will be so irrelevant to any decent company outside govt/SG after my bond is another thing entirely. I believe in helping the public and volunteer extensively outside in my local CC, so I came into the job a year ago with lots of enthusiasm but now I feel completely dead inside. I sense that my leaders + bosses + colleagues are mostly very uninspirational and do not care about excellence or actually creating impactful outcomes at work - they’re happy to show up and skate by on the bare minimum. Comparing this to NS in the army (which is also a govt organisation): at least I genuinely respected some of my NS regulars who were really damn good at certain aspects of their intense job. I can’t say the same about ANYONE where I work.\n\nWhile abroad, I interned at pretty good MNCs and had return offers, but of course I couldn’t take them due to the bond. Saw all my friends go on to earn big bucks but more importantly, open up way more doors for their future career trajectory by starting their career in coveted roles. Despite being initially promised exciting exposure to policy and shaping national strategies when I signed the scholarship, I’m now working in ultra-generalist menial roles that I genuinely think a secondary school kid could do. Feel like I was sold lies coming out of JC as I haven’t used my brain since joining or learnt a single useful thing that’d give me any leverage in the job market if I wanted to leave. The other scholars around and above me are all either resigned to their fate, or also horrendously unhappy. Why did the govt pay $500k for each of us to come back and rot?\n\nI feel like I’ve been pushed and pushed myself my whole life to excel ambitiously. But in govt, there’s hardly a no point (or benchmark) for achieving excellence because my work is so slow and detached from driving real outcomes, and the bonus structure doesn’t give me any real incentive to do so. This would be a great job if all I wanted to do was lepak and collect the steady paycheck but I feel like I am just wasting my life.\n\nI have actually made some money trading stocks and I am in a position to break my bond soon, am recruiting very heavily to get out of it which provides some solace. But man does it make me sad to realise how much time I wasted, and how the system here is wasting their human capital investments.\n\nAlmost every overseas scholar I’ve met across agencies and through friends hates their life and shares similar sentiments. Especially those that made the most of their experience abroad and didn’t just stay to the SG bubble.\n\nThe people at the top need to seriously re-examine how they develop talent or even hand out these scholarships - the current system is a product of a bygone era and sticking to it just will create a massive adverse selection problem for our country’s future. When your ‘brightest’ and most dynamic people come back to sub par opportunities, they’re gonna leave or break their bond ASAP. The yes men are predominantly the ones that stay in govt and rise up to become our future leaders and politicians. It’s very insular, and maybe this is why most new policies that come out of the government these days (especially related to job creation and upskilling) feels backward looking, behind the curve, and attempting to address problems from a highly detached position.\n\nAll I can say is, my exit interview will be glorious.

Not all, mind you, but it's quite a common complaint, and what I am guessing is that there is a disconnect between what you expect and what reality is.\n\nBecause you are a scholar, you likely expect to hit the ground running and given opportunities to show your capabilities. Good or bad, this isn't how public sector works. It is slow, methodical, by the books, and unlikely to challenge you the way you expect or desire to be challenged. \n\nThis was always going to be the gamble when taking up the offer, but this is no different from the private industry. If you get bonded, you have no idea if you're going to be in a place that's going to make good use of you and where you may learn something, or whether you get wasted and learn too little.\n\nYou're in year one.

Made me a *lot* more marketable in very specialised fields of work and that's how I ended up where I am now.  Only drawback was any time I had to deal with any other agency, none of whom seem to have managed the same QC when hiring.\n\nUp to you whether to stay or go.

The societal system in India allows the upper caste to get away with all kinds of crimes. Now, when a pro-CECA government like PAP shields these people, it further amplifies their ego that they are sovereign and above the law. Previous Ceca cases such as Ramesh Erramalli who worked in JP Morgan with a fake degree, has shown the other Cecas in Singapore that they can abuse people and get away with it. Hence, I have absolutely no faith in the justice system that this Ceca driver would get the appropriate punishments.\n\nOn my part, I don't support any pro-CECA party otherwise I won't be able to sleep at night, the PAP MPs who knock on my door every GE knows that I only have one request, that's to abolish CECA for the collective benefit of Singaporeans, I told them not to bother speaking to me until CECA is abolished, then overtime the door knock stops, because they know this request is impossible to fulfill as it's their fundamental core policy which is existential to their political survival.",

The driver still fking go tug on the kids hand??? Tf????? \n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/share/v/1K1Gmp2Rrj/\n---\n\n“This morning I walked to the market to buy coriander to make bánh mì. Because I forgot to order coriander, I went to the market and then witnessed a traffic accident this morning in the car park of the Chinese temple near Maxwell MRT. This was the first time in my life that I witnessed a traffic accident happen right in front of me, at around 11:40 a.m. today.\n\nI was the first person walking behind a mother and her child. A woman was driving out from the car park and did not look to her right for pedestrians; she only looked to her left while turning right. Then the front wheel of her car ran over the little girl’s stomach, after that it ran over the mother’s leg, and then the woman suddenly stepped hard on the accelerator, causing the rear wheel to run over the mother’s stomach. I don’t know why she accelerated so quickly right after exiting the car park. I guess they’re tourists. I can help and might be the one to testify in the traffic accident.\n\nI saw very clearly that when the accident happened, the front wheel had already run over a person and the driver should have felt that there was something under the car, but she did not stop to get out and check. Instead, she accelerated strongly and continued driving, which caused the rear wheel to run over the mother’s stomach one more time. I panicked and cannot remember clearly whether the rear wheel ran over the little girl again — I really can’t remember because I was in shock from what happened in front of me.\n\nAt the time of the accident, the woman’s husband was not with her — only the mother and child were there, and I was walking behind them. About two minutes later, the husband ran over and held the little girl in his arms. When the front wheel ran over the little girl, she rolled three times and ended up lying face down on the ground, with her mouth bleeding heavily. The father used a water bottle and a camera to block the blood, but the blood from the child’s mouth flowed a lot and spread all over the road.\n\nWhen the woman got out of the car from the back to look, she then realized that she had caused the accident. She shouted loudly at the father who was holding his daughter, and she tried to explain that she was not at fault.”\n",

But once you defeat that temptation, that “in-game monster” is gonna drop $7 for you to collect.\n\n  \n\nOnly managing your finances at the end of the month when bills are due is gonna be hard if you don’t have stop gaps every 30 days of the month.\n\n  \n\nSo go forth and defeat your daily temptations: reserve 1 day a week to treat yourself to a casual meal. Negotiate downwards how many drinks you’re gonna have at a social event. \n\n  \n\nFinances is as much internal as it is tangible.\n\n  \n\nFrom somebody who lives paycheck to paycheck, I managed this month with money leftover on payday so I see this game as a success even though I’m only level 3.\n\n  \n\nAnother pro tip: those with high credit card balances - and find yourself with little to no cash after payday. Convert your balance to installments and stop using CC. Use cash and you can eat $5 cai png instead of having to charge food to your credit to survive. It’s cheaper in the long run and prevents snowball. ",

Second, inflation rate is not actually equal for everyone.\n\nFor the first point, you might need to relook at whether 1.3m in 2036 (11 years from now) is actually enough. For the second point, you will need to see what you are actually spending on.\n\nIf you envision owning a car, multiple properties and frequent visits to hospital, those are things that are inflating at a very high rate in Singapore. So, inflation rate will be high.\n\nIf you envision taking public transport, eating more hawker and having a relatively healthy life, inflation is not as high.\n\nAnother thing people ignore is CPF. CPF is a bond-like instrument. Whether you like it or not, 37% of your income goes there so remember to factor it in.\n\nAssuming you have hit FRS, all excess above FRS can be taken out from 55 onwards.\n\nThis means from 55 onwards, the interest from OA of 2.5% is perpetually available for you to take out and amount never goes down as long as you only take out the interest.\n\nFrom 65 onwards, CPF pays out around 6% of your RA annually. This means it is like a 6% perpetual bond (note it does eat into the RA amount but otherwise, it functions just like a perpetual bond).\n\nSo in reality, you don't actually need as much to retire, provided you are ok to see your cash-funded assets go down before 55 before being supplemented later by cashflow from CPF.\n\nIt does make calculations much more complicated but those are things that are usually ignored for a simpler 4%SWR.\n\nAlso, the 4% SWR is already inflation-adjusted. Some people miss this point and even the researcher who came up with it says that people can actually draw up to 4+% (can't remember exact % but I guess you already know this) because again, another point people ignore is that in retirement, you usually spend less. No more travels, no more funding of kids' education, no more mortgages, etc.\n\nThat said, the SWR is meant for a 30-year retirement based on the research. So nobody knows how it performs for longer period but in theory, you can just reduce the SWR for higher success or start with more.\n\nIn any case, it is always good to err on side of caution but do also note that there are many people who retire on less than this amount TODAY in Singapore, granted the lifestyle will not be a glamorous 1.\n\nI suggest you first calculate the present value of 1.3m in 2036 then see if it meets what you feel would be enough today.",

      "selftext": "So finally, the broken clock is right. \n\nWith the huge downswing that we have seen in US markets, let's pause, take a step back, and rewind how this sell-off unfolded. \n\nIt all started with the SAAS companies, a little over 2 weeks ago. We saw major names in the software sector getting hit with sharp corrections on fears that AI and Claude, specifically, could disrupt their subscription based business model. \n\nThen earlier this week, we saw reports of friction between OpenAI and Nvidia, sparking a correction for the semiconductor sector. This week, after major tech giants reported an unprecedented, hyper-aggressive rise in capex spending, the entire tech sector just sold down. \n\nValuations are the single most crucial thing in investinng. Buying a super high quality business at a gargantuan valuation makes it a bad decision automatically. And by now, I'm sure that everyone would be familiar with the fact that what goes up, must come down. \n\nTo address the common wisdom that it's impossible to time a crash, and hence continously buying into US tech despite skyhigh valuations is justified, let me pose a simple question to you. Are you sure that the risk to reward ratio is in your favour? How probable is it that when the market continues to go up and tanks eventually, it will still be higher than the current price that you are buying it? \n\nMe personally, seeing this volatility, well, I'll be lying if I said it didn't feel soooo good to prove the haters wrong. But am I going to liquidate my position in my dividend stocks in HK and go all in on us tech? No. I'm going to continue to remain rationale. Should the valuations of the companies continue to go down, I may even start a SMALL TINY position in solid, blue chip US tech companies. But as of right now, I'll still be patiently waiting on the sidelines. \n\nTo those that saw huge drawdowns in your portfolio this week, please take a moment to pen down your thoughts and emotions. It really helps to guard against FOMO and hype chasing, a few months later down the road. Valuable lessons can be learnt from this drawdown.\n\nTo end with a quote, \"The stock market functions as a mechanism that transfers wealth from the impatient to the patient\". ~ Warren Buffett. \n",

It feels like there’s no clear “end point” to corporate life, unlike schooling where timelines were always defined.\n\nLately, I’ve been seriously considering stepping away from the corporate world after a few more years, perhaps take on a few months OR a year or two of break. Thereafter, possibly to pursue something more flexible (“own time, own target” - unfortunately I don’t have a concrete plan yet). \n\nThe main reason for staying on a few more years in the corporate world would be to build a larger buffer and investment portfolio, ideally one that can cover a good portion (or all) of my monthly expenses via passive income. That way, I feel that I will be less anxious about leaving my job at that point of time.\n\nWould appreciate perspectives from those who’ve done something similar:\n\nBefore leaving, did you aim for a specific portfolio size or expense multiple for peace of mind?\n\nHow old were you when you made the move?\n\nDid you eventually return to a full-time corporate role, or transition into something else?\n\nSeeking advice and shared experiences only — not looking to be flamed. 🙏 Thanks in advance.",

As the other commenter said, do make sure you have your ducks in a row for your financial commitments for the few months that you want to take a break. Set a timeline for yourself, take a break, find out what motivates you beyond the corporate life. After all, we work hard so that we can give ourselves some buffer when we can afford them.\n\nThe catch though is that we ARE unfortunately in a period where it's difficult to find a job. If possible, try and make sure you have your connections fresh as well for when you need to/are ready to enter the workforce. In the current climate, internal recommendations do go a long way.\n\nAll the best!",

Before he passed away recently, my late husband was a provider and paid for everything. My own income was only to pay for my own insurance &amp; investment.\n\nPreviously had plan to work lesser from age 54 onwards to travel the world with my husband but situation changes and I am now too depressed to deal with all the stress at work and business.\n\nCurrent Situation:\n\n* Income: Approx\\~ Annual: $200K ($100K-FT Job, $30K-Side hustle, $70K-Business)\n* Liquid Net Worth: Approx \\~ S$1.2mil ($440k in stocks &amp; S$800k in cash)\n   * planning to start to actively buying stocks on days when stocks are down.\n* CPF: OA: $150K  SA: $181K   MA: $77K\n* SRS: Approx: $52K\n* Property: Living alone in a fully Paid HDB (Approx worth 760K-800K)\n* Car: Fully Paid with almost 5yrs left on COE.\n\nLiabilities:\n\n* BTO estimated key collection in 2027 Q4 or 2028 Q1.\n   * Cost of BTO: 600K + 50K resale Levy = 650K\n      * intending to take maximum loan from bank.\n   * Estimated Renovation Cost = 100K\n   * Will be selling my current HDB (currently CPF used + AI = 155K)\n      * Cash proceeds estimated to be approx \\~ 500K after paying resale levy)\n* Monthly Expenses: \\~ Approx 6K (without overseas travel)\n* Used to travel 5-6 times a year and wish to continue to do so \\~ 30-40K per year\n\nI’m feeling tired from everything that has happened lately and wish to stop working after I move into my new BTO, approx 2028-Q1. I wish to take time to complete the things/goals  which my late husband and I had plan to do even if he isn't around anymore.\n\nMy concerns:\n\n* Can I retire in 2 years time with what I have currently?\n   * Hope to continue my side-hustle.\n   * Most of my stocks are currently sitting in high-risk counters (heavy tech)\n* ability to finance monthly BTO mortgage payment, intends to pay using my CPF-OA.\n* Ability to downpay for a new car in 2030 when current COE runs out, hope to continue driving the same range of vehicle that I am currently driving which is currently selling at 300K for a brand new unit. cant predict how much it will be in 2030.\n* Am I able to continue my current lifestyle without my income from work &amp; business?\n\nhappy to hear from people from all walks of life.\n\n  \nEdit:\n\nReally appreciate all the comments. I read thru every comment and think through it. Here are some answers that might make the picture clearer.\n\nMy life has changed against my will. Therefore here I am trying to rearrange my life after my soul mate of 25yrs suddenly departs from my life. \n\n*BTO:* \n\n* Have contacted HDB and they have exercise leniency in my case and allow me to keep the BTO. Application has also been changed to reflect my name only. \n* HPS does not work in this case because keys are yet to be collected. \n\n*Why take a loan for the BTO when I can fully paid it off?* \n\n* Original intention was to paid it off once we collect the keys so we don't have to worry about the other party financing the flat alone if one dies. \n* But situation changes now, his OA used +AI will now become cash proceeds when I sell instead of returning to his CPF-OA if he is still alive. I would rather keep the cash proceeds now and generate income from it while paying it slowly. If i happen to die with a loan, my beneficiary can just sell it off. \n\n*6K per month expenses &amp; travel expenses seems high*\n\n* I included cost of owning a car in the future (counting it as 2.5K in the expense for monthly repayments + vehicle expenses) into the predicted expenses. \n* Current expenses is less than 4K (including regularly investments and insurance), not counting one-time off stock purchases.  \n* Travel expenses and trips can always be adjusted, it just a wish to continue to what I used to do.\n\n*Liquid net* *worth, insurance payout, inheritance?*\n\n* No inheritance. Only a fully paid HDB, a fully paid car, CPF &amp; a business. \n* No insurance payout except DPS. He is not insurable, main reason why he wants me saves majority of my income for the future if he is gone. \n* Did not include valuables like gold, watches as I did not intend to sell unless I need the money for survival. (Est\\~300-350k after a haircut of 30% loss if I were to sell it)\n\n*Income:*\n\n* FT job \\~ 100K \n* Side hustle was approx \\~ 60-70K last year. But I project it be to 30K this year as I would just doing the minimum to keep myself relevant in the field.\n* Business \\~ it was my late husband business. Running a business that I am no prior experience in a lot of work and stress. But I would like to keep it going for as long as I can, no intention to just close or sell it even before I try, it was his effort and something he is passionate about but will let go once it becomes not profitable/sustainable. Income is just based of the salary I am current drawing, which is way below what he used to draw. Had to hire more help which thus increase in operating cost.  \n\n*Isn't there a income cap for bto buyers? How u get it in the first place?*\n\n* We applied it during covid years. I got no income from side hustle only FT job. His business was badly hit by covid for more than 2years. He did not draw any salary and sales drop 90%.  ",

Both of us are currently working full-time with unstable hours, frequent OT and occasional weekends. We’re staying with parents now but will be moving into our BTO soon, which is far from family support.\n\nDue to childcare constraints (often reaching home past 8pm), I’m considering stepping away from full-time work to be a SAHM after we move out. I’m conscious that this would likely be a one-way decision — I’m in tech and stepping away for several years would make returning extremely challenging.\n\nHusband’s role is more stable and it’s not ideal for him to quit, even though my income is currently higher.\n\nFinancials (Personal Assets):\n\n•\tTotal net worth: \\\\\\~550k\n\n•\tCPF: \\\\\\~230k (BTO payments not started yet)\n\n•\tInvestments: \\\\\\~170k\n\n•\t\\\\\\~60k US/tech stocks\n\n•\t\\\\\\~40k DBS shares\n\n•\tremainder in ILP\n\n•\tCash: \\\\\\~150k\n\nIncome (current):\n\n•\tMe: \\\\\\~110k p.a.\n\n•\tHusband: \\\\\\~80k p.a.\n\nWe’re expecting upcoming expenses for renovation, insurance, and higher household costs once we move out, so I’m cautious about liquidity.\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. Is it financially reasonable to rely on a single income (\\\\\\~80k p.a.) for household expenses in our situation?\n2. How much cash buffer would be prudent given BTO + reno in the near term?\n3. Any advice on managing investments/liquidity to support a single-income phase while preserving long-term financial flexibility?\n\nAppreciate any advice, especially from those who’ve gone through a single-income or SAHM phase.\n\nEdit:\n\nJust to clarify, the financials listed above are my personal assets, not combined household assets.\n\nI understand the feedback that relying on a single income may be challenging. Given that, I’d appreciate advice on how best to hedge against this risk if I were to step away from my job — specifically how to structure my existing assets (cash/investments/CPF) to provide additional security during a single-income phase.",

FOMO rush into investments that had already had a huge run up alr (you become other ppl's exit liquidity), and then panic sell when there's a short term selloff happening (it happens if you dont have convictions in your holdings). FX risks if investing in other currency denominated investments.",

But it also depends on your own risk appetite and goals. (Con) Trump (for now at least) - there's a great deal of market manipulation. One week he will threaten tariffs like a spoilt brat (with the powers of a president), and the next he will claim world peace. Case in point - look at the Greenland episode recently.\n\nIf you're looking for dividends (Pro) - you can consider SG stocks. (Con) Do note that SG stocks are highly *not* recommended for capital gains - STI has been going sideways for the past 30Y. However, given that SG Gov / MAS is pushing for more reforms, there could potentially be some action in the next 5Y period.",

Nowadays I set a rule for myself- 10% down from all time high I open my warchest (6 months current expenses) and deploy 50%, every 2.5% further down I deploy 25% then 25%. Suggest to make it numbers-based to remove emotions. This way I don’t feel fomo or sad that my overall portfolio is going down when there’s a recession since I’m buying things at a bargain. Also set a limit to the amt of warchest I keep so I’m not keeping too much cash on hand.
