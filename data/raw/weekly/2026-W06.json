It's described as being about shopping malls but it's actually aboutdecentralisation of workplaces and express trains.\n\nThe account also has a few good takes on transport in Singapore in general, and the discussion is surprisingly nuanced. Reminds me a bit of tehsiewdai's stuff which I've shared before.",

The commute in mind-numbing, especially with young kids who crave attention. Unless you want to surrender and placate them with phone videos. A four-hour 2-way commute (at minimum) is not appealing, especially when you can't eat or drink along the way. EDIT] This also reminds me of back in my NS days, when I chose to stay-in at Clementi Camp, because fuck the commute back to Pasir Ris with all my barang barang. Staying-in allowed me to have humane levels of rest and free food, plus savings on transport costs (back when salary was $350+/mth).",

It would be akin to building on the Center wing middle floor which can be quickly connected to the other parts and act as a radial transport hub. The idea of decentralised workplaces don’t work well in today Singapore because:\n1. Dual income is the norm, couples are unlikely to be able to work at the same place\n2. Job loyalty doesn’t pay off and it’s optimal and common to job hop compared to moving your house, leading to people taking likely long commutes\n3. New estates are at the corners of the island, and the bidding process and long wait makes it even harder to match with your workplace before you change jobs.",

It is highly targeted. The good news is it reduces entry rejection in Singapore after a long flight. OZ have yet to implement and they are trialling it at Brisbane and Sydney only with Qantas. The reason Brisbane was choice as first pilot is to plan ahead for 2030 Olympics which Brisbane is hosting. Theya re trying to avoid en-bloc MIA of African athletes on landing for the commonwealth games. This new directive will expose our internal security and intelligence apparatus to some extent hence the hesitation by sovereign nations to implement it as part of APP. The appeal process will taxing as it will require legal representation unlike APP where you increase passport validity or get the right visa to fix the issue at boarding, no appeal needed.",

SG can keep allowing for no visa entry and at the same time get more help from the airlines to block some travel. Less people they’ll need to hold in a room in changi. I think some countries, by policy, already assist with this. Philippines really scrutinizes travel into SG for example. I live and work in SG. I am an American and I travel around the SEA for my work. Sometimes when I’m returning to SG I am scrutinized, for a lack of a better term, while they are holding my passport. I have wondered what would happen if they deemed I shouldn’t enter SG but at the same time, to deny me would make me overstay my visa of wherever I’m at. Would they give me a free flight home? Ha. Probably not. And probably airlines would just allow people with circumstances like me to fly anyway and be stopped by SG if they deemed necessary.",

As expected, there are road closures and motorists are advised to take alternative routes. Our Indian friends have been celebrating Thaipusam for many years already.\n\nI was discussing with a coworker, and he mentioned he was quite relieved that it falls on a Sunday this year, so he doesn’t need to take leave. And it would be nice if everyone could get one more public holiday, since Chinese and Malays already have two religious holidays each.\n\nWhy hasn’t Thaipusam been made a public holiday by now ? When it falls on a weekday, many people take leave anyway, which affects productivity regardless. Wouldn’t it make more sense to just formalise it as a PH ?\n\nAlso, Vesak Day is celebrated by Buddhists, who are mostly Chinese. I'm yet to meet a Indian Buddhist so I’m not entirely sure why Vesak Day is grouped under Indian holiday. Might be there in other countries. Happy to be corrected on this.\n\nAlso there is another festival pongul for Indians which is celebrated for a few days. Atleast give us 1 more PH la.\n\nCurious to hear what others think.\n\nEdit : I understand there are many other Indian communities other than Tamil. Respect that. I want to focus on Thaipusam since it is widely known.\n\nEdit : like someone mentioned I won't be surprised we might get a founder's day before we get another PH for Indians lol.",

Look... \"staying out till late\" and \"going on a solo trip\",are not the same thing. They are definitely \"quite different\". That said, I think your other trips are much more relevant, so focus on those. Consider the differences in those experiences:\n1. Length - were the other trips also of similar length? Every extra day is extra planning to be done.\n2. Destination - are those countries particularly safer? Or, nearer/easier to get to? What are the people typically like? \n3. Activities - did the trips revolve around city areas, or was there often terrain / environmental danger involved? \n4. Emergency plan - in the event of emergency, what's the plan? Who can you call, and who can your parents call? If there's a good difference in any of these questions, then that's probably what they're focused on. Otherwise, if your previous trips are very similar, you can try to drill down on what exactly is it that gives them so much pause. So that’s why I was disappointed that they didn’t trust me enough. It's often not you. As any driver will tell you, the biggest hazard on the road is \"other drivers\". The best driver in the world can still get into an accident as long as there's one other reckless person. They may not doubt your skill and independence, but rather the things/people that you are exposing yourself to. But again, although I think that it's bullshit to make such a big threat out of \"love\", the fact is that people won't always say what they mean, and strangers will be even worse to tourists.",

I’m curious how accurate this sounds to locals.\n\nLevel 1: You own a dogHaving a dog in Singapore is expensive. Vaccinations, vets, permits, general upkeep, it all adds up fast. According to them, if you see someone walking a dog, that person is definitely not poor.\n\nLevel 2: You own a carCar ownership is on another level. They said it’s roughly two to three times more expensive than in Dubai. Import duties, insurance, and especially the licence to own a car make it prohibitive. We roughly calculated that a Mercedes E-Class could end up costing around USD 300k.\n\nLevel 3: You have two or more childrenThis was described as the real “wealth tier”. Education is extremely expensive, nannies are costly, and then you add extracurriculars, clubs, activities, camps, and so on. If you’re raising two or more kids in Singapore, you’re doing very well financially.\n\nDoes this way of looking at wealth in Singapore resonate at all, or does it sound off? How would you personally describe the so called levels of wealth?\n\nGenuinely curious to hear local perspectives.",

      "selftext": "Hi all, I have worked in the government job for 10 years, had various stints at statboard and ministries alike. most of the times, I get C or C+, though I never gotten Bs, but I was never the worst performer. Last week, I had been called in for a performance review to be put on PRP.\n\nGranted I am not a stellar performer, but I do my job diligently and try my best. In the first year, I think I was not performing up to standard according to my boss and was asked what are the reasons. I explained that I think there is a job mismatch but I will try my best to learn. However, I find the directions given to me very vague and a lot of times, I just could not nail it. My boss also mentioned that when she hired me, she thought that I am well-versed in handling media. However, I mostly did events  where some were quite high profile and were covered by medias. I guess it is on me that I thought that those were the same as media engagement.\n\nAfter 6 months, I realised that the scope of work is totally off and anything I proposed were just getting shot down. After that, I lost confidence and kept a low profile. I began doing menial tasks, get heavily involved in other department's work. after 1.5 years, I really just cant seem to get the grip of things.\n\nThat said, my bosses were not great, in fact, the entire department were complaining and looking for other job themselves. Naturally, I started the same and was lucky that I scored some interviews. Recently, I have a few second round interviews with other ministries/agencies, and am waiting for official offer.\n\nHowever, last week's performance review came, and they say that my grading will be recorded and it would be shared throughout the entire government record. They indirectly advise me to leave asap but I was adamant to stay for the bonus. We ended with that I will resign when I qualify for my bonus, which when she said to me that my \"bad\" grading would be included and stay in government records forever, and I better secure the offer before its being included as it would affect my future opportunities.\n\nAlso, not to play the blame game, my bosses are getting absolutely pummeled by the senior management team. Our senior management also commented that the middle management (my bosses) are not up to standard, which further validates my view that as much as I am not up to standard, they cannot just pin all the blames on me alone...\n\nLet say in worse case scenario, I get Ds/Es, how screwed am I? Also, I am afraid that once the PRP sets in, HR would inform my potential new hiring agency/ministry that I am currently on PRP and drop me after HR checks... thanks in advance!\n\n*Edit: My bosses also claimed to have provided email coaching, which for the record, I do not receive much. There is not even face to face consultation. When she asked for a piece of work, I would complete it, check through with my colleague (who is supposedly the best performer) and get her green light. But she will come back with not good enough etc. I have recorded and documented our last 3 months email exchanges and I am quite sure not one is a 'coaching' email... Heck, what is 'receiving coaching through emails' anyway???",

However, need to ownself calculate a bit. If he can drive Grab (as a side gig) and make more than the required amount to pay off every month using the debt repayment scheme, then it would be wiser to just go with option 2. edit: assuming OP's friend sold the car and he's left with 100K payment. The debt repayment scheme allows you to manage the debt but musn't be more than 5 years. So, at best, it would be around $1,677 per month. That means he has to find a side gig or cut down on his expenses. I would personally  go with option 3... Rather bite the bullet than suffer the pain and uncertainty in the long run. You don't know if the car breaks down and how much the repairs would be in the next 10 years or so.

Tech industry is incredibly terrible right now due to multiple of factors (e.g. AI, Trump, outsourcing, weaken economic outlook, tech bubble burst, bootcamps) I know a couple of 5 to 10 years veterans who are still jobless for more than a year now. The situation is much more grim for fresh graduates who is now completing with more experienced professionals who is willing to price themselves lower. I also notice the tone from tech recruiters who give career advise have change and become more pessimistic, from \"Just cold call and tailor your resume, you will land a role within months\" to \"Expect not being able to get in the industry for 1 to 2 years\" i applied even to listings up to a month old and i focused on all tech entry level jobs or jobs not directly tech but accepted tech background, these contribute to the high numbers Is good that you apply for adjacent roles, consider applying for roles that need your skills and capabilities, even if is not an even 50% match from your expectations. Here is what I recommend/suggest: Option A - If you really really want to get into tech: A stellar resume. A lot lecturers and some career consultant give shit advise on resume because they have been out of the force for a quite awhile. Avoid those aesthetics resume, I notice a lot of my SWE pals have \"fun\" looking resumes that are very difficult to read for HR/recruiter, so they end up in the discard pile. See what common phases and keywords that is written in the JDs, try to input those keywords organically and tailor it. Use ChatGPT if you need help but DON'T BLINDLY ACCEPT IT, take a scan, it has tendencies input random achievements. Expand your network via hackathons, voluntary, networking events if someone has a connection in a role you are interested in they can refer you in organisations or give you advise. This also shows you are passionate about the field. I landed in my current role, because I met 2 people in a community event, one of them give me tips on what to say for that company and other is the colleague of the interviewer, so they vouched for me. Upskill yourself, show you are passionate and willing to learn. Explain how such skills/courses make you a more valuable employee. \"I learn x software, which means I can assist and read Y\". As you scan the JDs, keep a lookout on common skills and keywords they used. Continue be open to roles is adjacent to the industry and roles you have the skill for, since you need a foot in. Example, data analytic, Quality Assurance, Business Analytics, IT Support etc. Lastly, I want to acknowledge the feeling and the experience you have is valid, the economy for tech is bad. Is quite common for people who end up in jobs that they didn't study for in.",

U have to cater ur resume for the roles u apply. Just sell the shit out of urself even if ur skillsets aren’t as glamorous as it sounds. If u just came out of cs degree, python’s one of the most sought after skills, put that in the resume and maybe a Git link to a sample app, no need for anything fancy. One that demonstrates ur understanding of algorithms and if u have the time which u probably do, design a well structured one. One that caters to the user’s interactions (UX and UI) impresses most. It could be an app or site that only has a basic page with a list of products on it or whatever, and a login page. If u dont have any of that, then i think it’s time to brush or pick up some skills… youtube and chatGpt is a good source to develop one. Interviewers would be interested in ur thought process during the creation of the app/site - why did u design it this way? How did u do this login page or how do u authenticate and authorise the users? Is the site/app scalable? What’s the architectural design behind this (mvc, mvvm etc)? Thats only if u dont have buffed portfolios like 90% of the fresh grads out there… i have some crazy fresh grad friends that participated/won hackathons, interned at some big named companies and/or has personal projects that can blow one’s minds… Make ur resume stand out and highlight ur best points, essentially coming back to my point - sell the shit out of urself.

If you need to take public transport, than do short distance trips first. Like 2-3 stops, which would be around a 10 minute train ride. Enough to get them slowly familiar with riding the train and it's a short enough trip that they won't get too overstimulated. Also bring them to more outdoor places, like parks and gardens. It'll be quieter and less crowded than a shopping mall. Plus most parks have a playground area so they can burn off energy and distract themselves with playing. Basically don't rush the process. Instead of doing full day trips with cranky children, do a shorter outing in the morning, go home to rest and nap in the afternoon (so you also avoid the worse of this heat), and then spend the evenings somewhere nearby.

I used to work corporate, but have taken a step back because it feels like such a waste if no one continues this, and serving local food we are proud of.\n\nWe’re on our feet for hours.

There’s almost no real “break”, just different kinds of work.\n\nManpower is a constant headache too. Hiring non-local staff is getting harder with all the rules, and locals understandably expect higher pay because living costs here are no joke. We really want to pay more and hire more locals, but our margins are already super thin. Rent keeps going up. Supplier prices keep increasing. Utilities, ingredients, packaging, wages, everything has gone up.\n\nThen there’s the customer side. Most are nice, and we’re very grateful. But sometimes we meet really unreasonable people who treat us like we owe them something. It can be quite disheartening. Some days we just look at each other and wonder… is it even worth continuing?\n\nWhenever we adjust prices to keep up with rising costs, there will definitely be complaints. But the truth is, we’re always trying to balance being affordable with simply surviving. We can’t compete with big chains and multinational brands that have scale, systems, and pricing power that us small local businesses just don’t have.\n\nWe’re always thankful for every bit of support, but there’s this constant worry about whether its sustainable. Behind the scenes, it’s a daily struggle to make the numbers work, while still serving food we’re proud of.\n\nTo those who are patient, who understand that small businesses are run by very tired humans just doing their best, rly thank you 😭\n\nJust curious, what makes you choose to support a local business and when will people be willing to start paying more for local food?",

Minor service hiccups are fine. At least two out of the four dishes we order should be exceptional. One place that executes this well is Dumpling Darlings. 3. Nostalgia placesThese are legacy businesses or places known for classic dishes. My expectations here are lower in some ways. I forgive bad service because I know how hard it is to keep these places running. I even forgive price hikes, as long as they aren’t astronomical. But the food must taste the same as it always did. The day my soon kueh place or laksa stall starts cutting corners, I stop going. I understand there will always be some variability due to sourcing or preparation, but it needs to be good at least four out of five times.

Milestone placesThese are for big moments—birthdays with a zero in them, important anniversaries, reunions—events where the food becomes part of the memory. Here, I expect near-flawless execution. I don’t want a single variable I need to worry about. Prices can be high, but they must be earned. Most dishes should be excellent, and ideally, memorable. Across all categories, there’s one non-negotiable: the food should actually be cooked. I’ve encountered too many places where food is centrally prepared by a vendor and the restaurant is essentially a glorified microwave. I hope such places slowly shut down and realize this isn’t acceptable. If I want reheated frozen food, I’ll get it from FairPrice.",

Yet the moment it’s “just” a plate of noodles or fried rice, it’s seen as nothing special, espcially given how we grow up with the same type of food since young. Hawker-style food is usually fast and efficient, and the focus has always been on speed, flavour, and price. But if the same fried hor fun were served in an air-conditioned space, like a food court or casual restaurant, would people really be willing to pay $15++ for it? I think most people would demand more premium ingredients if so. Sometimes it feels like local dishes are judged by a different standard, even though the skill, labour, and effort behind them can be just as much (if not more).

A lot of people think quality and effort automatically brings people to your food through word of mouth, but I think peoples eating habits are so different now. People dont hang out at hawkers like the uncles do, they hang out at malls. You meet at a mall and then u find some food nearby. Your game is then not to just provide consistency and value because youre not appealing to the people around you. Your game becomes how can you build a name for yourself that people will talk about. USP:When I eat your food it has to make me think \"damn theres this thing about your food that is so amazing, if anyone ever mentions this I need to talk about it\". It also has to appeal to the listener. Think about the long lines outside hot hideout, what are people there for? The lotus root ,potato chips, scrambled egg, literally cant get them in any other mala, and its something the listeners will perk up for. Branding:Also the name is quotable, not like bedok 553 hokkien mee, id literally forget that name the moment the convo changes. There are a lot of hawker stalls that my friends have recommended me before and they are daaamn good like id gone back multiple times cos I actually liked it. But I would never have even gone to have a look if they didnt literally force me to go cos why would I care about \"this damn good chicken rice at the bishan hawker after the bus stop walk straight for 10 minutes\". like my brain too small to remember that bro.

(example: beach road scissor cut curry rice gives 1 result, hambaobao, bishan chicken rice gives many results) I also wanted to type stuff about forming a community (be nice to people, be present in front of the stall) and marketing. But I think the main point is that theres already a lot of talk about a hawker's food quality or price (expectation high, beat expectation difficult, just make it good enough) and people just dont care about the soft aspects of business (hawkering is an actual business, use your business chops) edit: since your post had a mention of bad customers, in business theres this 80/20 rule where 80% of your income comes from 20% of your customers (super users that will be repeat customers and shout your name everywhere they go), try to find your super users, dont care about the 80% who just come once or twice and leave.",

Then rename or tagline around that, make it dead easy to repeat in a convo and easy to type into Google Maps. Photos on Maps + consistent name across signboard, GrabFood, IG all matter more than people realise. On marketing, I’d test one platform first (usually IG or TikTok), post simple behind-the-scenes and “how we cook this” clips, and reply to local food threads on Reddit/Telegram when people ask for recs. Tools like Meta Business Suite, Google Business Profile and Pulse for Reddit are decent for this kind of low-budget, “show up where people are already talking” approach.

It’s always served with sliced baguette to mop up the sauce, and it’s virtually impossible to eat without staining your fingers (and shirt) red. ​The Cheat Sheet ​The Vibe: Primal. You eat with your hands and make a mess.\n​The Taste: Like a spicy, savory tomato jam with a deep mutton finish. ​The \"Holy Grail\": The gelatinous marrow (the \"shake and tap\" or \"straw\" method). ​Pro Tip: Wear a black shirt. The red stain is permanent.\n​Where to go (The \"Big Three\"): ​Haji Kadir (Golden Mile): The OG. They claim to have invented it in the 50s.\n​Deen Tiga Rasa (Golden Mile): Known for a slightly more complex, \"three-flavor\" sauce.\n​M.A. Deen Biasa (Jalan Sultan): The \"King of Soup Tulang,\" popular for late-night supper.\n​Would you like me to map out a \"Mamak Route\" for you in the Beach Road/Golden Mile area?",

Their work culture was like a “family” as they call it, with christian quotes written on some boards. Didnt enjoy it as an introvert due to the environment which prioritised socialising>work quality, but that’s just me. We had to attend weekly meetings, which was often hosted by Melvin Lim, and got paid $800 per month as mentioned by the redditor who disclosed everyone’s salaries. Late fee of $10 applicable to interns as well if late for meetings, money requested by events team which goes to pantry supplies. The best thing from this scandal is Marc filling in as Interim CEO. He was a genuinely nice person who gave good feedback and listened to our presentations when our mentor would be sick/apply for leave on our presentation days. Can’t say the same for anyone else there though. Could tell that Carrie the HR person didn’t like interacting with interns as well\n\n(edit: adding on that every week required by mentor to interview 2 agents on their closed cases which was ridiculously hard since theyre too busy to show up/will ghost u online, have to text like 30 of them for example at once to get 2 to reply to u within that wee…waste of time since all information is already recorded previously)",

      "selftext": "I studied in the UK/US at a great uni and am currently serving my 6 year bond. My work thus far in the public service for an economic related Ministry/Statboard has been so bad and I honestly preferred my time serving NS in my chiong sua combat unit…. If I had known what it’d be like I would’ve passed on the scholarship and gone to local U happily\n\nMicromanaging bosses, meaningless paper pushing work, bizarre SOPs and internal office initiatives are bad enough. Realizing that I’m not developing any skills and that I will be so irrelevant to any decent company outside govt/SG after my bond is another thing entirely. I believe in helping the public and volunteer extensively outside in my local CC, so I came into the job a year ago with lots of enthusiasm but now I feel completely dead inside. I sense that my leaders + bosses + colleagues are mostly very uninspirational and do not care about excellence or actually creating impactful outcomes at work - they’re happy to show up and skate by on the bare minimum. Comparing this to NS in the army (which is also a govt organisation): at least I genuinely respected some of my NS regulars who were really damn good at certain aspects of their intense job. I can’t say the same about ANYONE where I work.\n\nWhile abroad, I interned at pretty good MNCs and had return offers, but of course I couldn’t take them due to the bond. Saw all my friends go on to earn big bucks but more importantly, open up way more doors for their future career trajectory by starting their career in coveted roles. Despite being initially promised exciting exposure to policy and shaping national strategies when I signed the scholarship, I’m now working in ultra-generalist menial roles that I genuinely think a secondary school kid could do. Feel like I was sold lies coming out of JC as I haven’t used my brain since joining or learnt a single useful thing that’d give me any leverage in the job market if I wanted to leave. The other scholars around and above me are all either resigned to their fate, or also horrendously unhappy. Why did the govt pay $500k for each of us to come back and rot?\n\nI feel like I’ve been pushed and pushed myself my whole life to excel ambitiously. But in govt, there’s hardly a no point (or benchmark) for achieving excellence because my work is so slow and detached from driving real outcomes, and the bonus structure doesn’t give me any real incentive to do so. This would be a great job if all I wanted to do was lepak and collect the steady paycheck but I feel like I am just wasting my life.\n\nI have actually made some money trading stocks and I am in a position to break my bond soon, am recruiting very heavily to get out of it which provides some solace. But man does it make me sad to realise how much time I wasted, and how the system here is wasting their human capital investments.\n\nAlmost every overseas scholar I’ve met across agencies and through friends hates their life and shares similar sentiments. Especially those that made the most of their experience abroad and didn’t just stay to the SG bubble.\n\nThe people at the top need to seriously re-examine how they develop talent or even hand out these scholarships - the current system is a product of a bygone era and sticking to it just will create a massive adverse selection problem for our country’s future. When your ‘brightest’ and most dynamic people come back to sub par opportunities, they’re gonna leave or break their bond ASAP. The yes men are predominantly the ones that stay in govt and rise up to become our future leaders and politicians. It’s very insular, and maybe this is why most new policies that come out of the government these days (especially related to job creation and upskilling) feels backward looking, behind the curve, and attempting to address problems from a highly detached position.\n\nAll I can say is, my exit interview will be glorious. Feel free to ask me anything, not like I’m doing anything important at work",

Not all, mind you, but it's quite a common complaint, and what I am guessing is that there is a disconnect between what you expect and what reality is. Because you are a scholar, you likely expect to hit the ground running and given opportunities to show your capabilities. Good or bad, this isn't how public sector works. It is slow, methodical, by the books, and unlikely to challenge you the way you expect or desire to be challenged. This was always going to be the gamble when taking up the offer, but this is no different from the private industry. If you get bonded, you have no idea if you're going to be in a place that's going to make good use of you and where you may learn something, or whether you get wasted and learn too little. You're in year one. Why not give it a fair shake with an open mind. I remember one CEO once told me, if people aren't making good use of you, you have to make yourself valuable somehow and should not wait for people to give you these opportunities.",

Or at least it isn’t a complete waste of money compared to if you had less. IFAs are often not fee-based, they just sell multiple insurance company products and earn commission, so make sure you don’t use this type. Endowus is a very decent mix of user-friendly with acceptable fees. IBKR is cheapest for many things (including Pimco GIS Income Fund) but not so easy to use. The Pimco GIS Income Fund is a ”bond-focus fund”. The bonds inside are a bit more risky and somehow they use some leverage, so the payouts are higher. There are slightly different “flavours” as well, like Pimco GIS Diversified Income Fund. Money market fund is very safe, but the returns are under 1.5% p.a. now so it won’t help you meet your goal of ~5% p.a. in “dividends”. And don’t get tricked into USD mmf with higher interest because the FX risk will just get you instead. Other products that I think could help you are 1) Allianz Income and Growth (can get thru Endowus for lower fees). This is about 1/3 US equities and 2/3 bonds, but the bonds are the riskier type and half perform more like equities. Read this for a more thorough explanation of pros and cons: https://investmentmoats.com/fund/allianz-income-growth-good-returns-for-past-3-years-sustain-7-income-yield/ 2) Amova Singapore Dividend Equity Fund (can’t  buy directly from Endowus, but you can buy from Poems or Dollardex then transfer to Endowus, and Endowus will let you buy more after that).  This is composed of Singapore stocks and gives out 5% p.a. dividends monthly while doing a pretty good job of maintaining or growing capital. A bit less bank-heavy than the Straits Times Index, and you pay higher fees but they solve the monthly payout problem for you. S-REITs also inside, so it’s good for “dummies”. People will probably tell you to invest in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for the lowest fees, but then you need to sell to create your “dividend”, and it requires more financial literacy.

Yield is high for all classes but is also because it doesn't take into account hedging cost. USDSGD hedging cost now, with how volatile the USD is, probably is >2% p.a., this will come out of your NAV. On yields, well lots of nations now are looking at USD in a different light, even if they do have more rate cuts it's likely the yields won't move much at all, hence it's duration position won't offer much upside. Long story short, NAV likely to erode, your 6% dividend net of fees and hedging cost, is typically closer to 3%, assuming spreads stay tight and yields are constant On AIG the dividend yield stated is not an organic yield. The organic yield of the fund is closer to 2+ 3%, due to its mix of HY bonds, convertibles and equities that are ALL US centric.

So the brain fills the gap with anxiety.\nOne thing I wish I understood earlier: milestones like “1M” or “own place” aren’t destinations. They’re just coordinates along a much longer path.\nAt 28, the most valuable asset you’re building isn’t the 200k. It’s the fact that you’re already on a stable, compounding trajectory.\nThe danger isn’t renting or buying late. It’s letting future goals make the present feel like failure.\nIf I could tell my younger self one thing, it’d be this:\ndon’t judge your life using endgame metrics while you’re still in the accumulation phase.\nYou’re not behind.

Basically there was a bond bloodbath in 2022 when interest rates were jacked up (so older low interest bonds inside bond funds lost value. Then as the Feds have been cutting interest rates over the past one year plus, those bond funds are regaining value because the old, high interest bonds inside are better than the newly issued ones. You should also know that there are 2 versions of this fund. Yours is “icdiv” and there is another “irc”. https://www.ifastgm.com.sg/igm/admin/buy/highlight/highlightJPM139.pdf Dividends paid by “(irc)” share classes are further adjusted, up or down for, respectively, an estimated positive or negative interest rate carry.\nDividends paid by “(icdiv)” share classes are expected to include a distribution from\ncapital as well as the gains of the Share Class. It sets a predetermined percentage\nrate that is not linked to income or capital gains. During periods of negative performance, the dividend will normally continue to be paid and the value of the investment may fall more rapidly. The overall returns of the two versions are the same (can see on your FSM), but the “irc” dividend yield is only 6+%, while the NAV went up 5%. So I think the “real” dividend is 6%, and when the bond prices went up, your version “icdiv” gave out that gain as extra dividends to maintain the price. I would not expect this fund to continue to perform this spectacularly in the future.",

While he’s from Tennessee and speaks mainly to an American audience, many of his concepts are quite universal. For starters, if you haven’t already done so, do what you can to get to a $1000 emergency fund. This is the bare minimum to tide you through dire times (illness/injury, job loss, unexpected expense) on a bare bones budget. Then the next step would be to pay down your debt. While much of your debt is zero interest, I would still consider paying it down before further bolstering your emergency fund because you don’t want to gamble (pun intended) on your friends’ and family’s goodwill. After that you can start bolstering your emergency fund to about 3-6 months of expenses. Post back after you’ve completed these steps. Wishing you success in your journey.",

Cons: not exactly tracking the \"main brand\" indices so future performance may vary. Just launched (2024), low volume and shorter track record. Note: EUR, not in USD according to what I found. So idk how it might work with IBKR, I assume no change but im not 100% sure. fwra: Pros: VWRA but cheaper + instead of Vanguard, its invesco. Cons: low volume, relatively new as well. vwra: Pros: high liquidity, broader than ACWD in terms of \"coverage\", vanguard is a giant and staple company for investments. Cons: higher TER, no exposure to small caps. acwd Pros: lower cost than VWRA and still covers decent coverage.

If you want more small cap exposure there's some offerings by DFA(Dimensional Fund Advisors), but you really should understand that its an actively managed ETF that's not just market cap weighted ETF. Therefore the TER for DFA is higher. DFA to me is super interesting, but you have to know they haven't beat the market in the last few years because the large cap US stocks have performed so well in the last few cycles. By the way that they do their fund, it will increase the exposure to small cap stocks, value stocks. They also recently launched Irish docimiled ETFs. They actively use finance research, and their funds are designed to beat the market, which prior to the tech rally, they do beat vanguard's funds and sometimes do beat the market. I am not paid in anyway by those funds or youtube videos, just like you are curious what others think. I'm personally leaning to SWRD+EIMI just for the time being as DFA irish funds are super new aka low liquidity. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfknibBat2A https://www.dimensional.com/us-en/etfs",

Heard that ACWD is the closest to VWRA amongst the others, as they track close to 3000 entities whilst VWRA is around 4000+. Taking into account that ACWD already tracks so many entities, thus the fact that they are only 0.12 in TER compared to VWRA probably means over the long-term they should have a higher returns of achieving better returns? Just curious, if you guys have any ETFs to recommend other than VWRA where I feel that the 0.19 TER will eat into my profits over the long run.

I’m thankful that I’ve not faced unemployment — I always had another offer lined up before tendering, typically taking a short 1–2 month break between roles, clearing my ALs for self love.\n\nOver the past few months though, I’ve been feeling increasingly drained and unmotivated, with a fair bit of anxiety whenever the next day is a working day. It feels like there’s no clear “end point” to corporate life, unlike schooling where timelines were always defined.\n\nLately, I’ve been seriously considering stepping away from the corporate world after a few more years, perhaps take on a few months OR a year or two of break. Thereafter, possibly to pursue something more flexible (“own time, own target” - unfortunately I don’t have a concrete plan yet).\n\nThe main reason for staying on a few more years in the corporate world would be to build a larger buffer and investment portfolio, ideally one that can cover a good portion (or all) of my monthly expenses via passive income. That way, I feel that I will be less anxious about leaving my job at that point of time.\n\nWould appreciate perspectives from those who’ve done something similar:\n\nBefore leaving, did you aim for a specific portfolio size or expense multiple for peace of mind?\n\nHow old were you when you made the move?\n\nDid you eventually return to a full-time corporate role, or transition into something else?\n\nSeeking advice and shared experiences only — not looking to be flamed. 🙏 Thanks in advance.",
