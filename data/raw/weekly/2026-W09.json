They do not need to pack the trains, it is an infrastructure that is not just speedy, but very comfortable (non air con buses were a thing).\n\nToday, even the dumpster fire that is NEL and NSL could not make them expedite building the Seletar Line. No matter how many people have been lobbying them over the years, they just would not extend JRL to CCL before “2040s”, the same crappy timeline as the long delayed Seletar line.\n\nMRT is just one, but not the only thing, that had regressed as our country got wealthier.\n\nAs we get wealthier, the more quality of life stuff gets cut. MRT becomes more crowded while fares go up. Housing becomes smaller while prices go up. Rental prices so high the only things we get to enjoy are the same old franchises and chains.\n\nFor the older generations, they were so loyal to the government because the wealthier the nation, the better things were.\n\nFor us, the wealthier the nation, the worse things seem to get.

As at 6:30 pm today,(It is still raining so it will take some time to compile)\n\n\nThere has been a grand total of 57 mm recorded in Singapore on average. To put this is perspective, the normal thunderstorm in Singapore delivers about 5 to 20 mm and anything above 30 mm is considered great (This excludes monsoon surges which are a whole other league)\n\n\nOver the last 4 days, we have recorded 139 mm which is very close to the average monthly rainfall of around 150 to 180 mm. This is after the terrible performance at the start of the month. Temperatures have also been tempered at around 29 for highs and the lowest was 21.8 at Newton.(It has been extremely long since a thunderstorm caused such a fall in temps without a monsoon surges)\n\n\nThe top 3 best performing weather stations for the 4 days, Ulu Pandan - 277.6 mm Clementi - 252.6 mm Kent Ridge - 196.4 All southwest/west Top 3 worst Paya Lebar - 66.2 mm East Coast Park - 70.8 mm Tai Seng - 73 mm Mostly eastern.

And no, it wasn’t exchanged with complimentary drink coupons because I saw that they paid with their mobile wallet. Inside my head, I was thinking if youths can only afford such drinks nowadays.\n\nI then casually asked if they knew what a Flaming Lamborghini was. They looked at each other, and then back at me, shaking their head and all puzzled.\n\n“Well you’re about to find out”. I then proceeded to buy them a Flaming Lamborghini each.\n\nThe staff there was also stunned at the order. It seemed as if he hadn’t prepared the drink in a long time. His senior came and then showed him how it was done.\n\nWhen the drink was served, I showed them how it was drunk. “Everything at once! No stopping” before I sipped it all down with the fire.\n\nThey were so fascinated and amazed at that moment. I probably unlocked a core memory for them all. \n\nAfter the drinks, I looked at them and told them casually “This is what me and my friends used to drink every time we clubbed last time.”\n\nI then foot the bill and left them to party. It was like $45 a pop (after service charge and GST) so it ended up being around $200+. It used to be $28 or so and there was like 1-1 promo so probably $14 each.\n\nSo yeah, it’s expensive no shit.

Then repeat the 2nd day but with lesser places but still end up going home after 11pm. \n\nHonestly, we all know that we will never see or be close to some of these relatives after CNY. And I feel it's no need to visit them as they don't even bother to return the visit. (According to my dad visiting should be 礼尚往来, like if pple come our hse, we die die must visit them too) And my dad had complained about it every year, still visits for show - \"see I am at the higher ground, u owe me visits!\"\n\nSome attendance to me is just not worth marking. \n\nAnother reason is, I am a gig worker. FESTIVE seasons, esp CNY is like the best time to earn extra. Its not like money vs relationship but more like I know from some of their responses that if I ever run into an emergency (choi!!) and needed help, there's low to no chance they will even help. They probably just generous with their naggings and judgements.\n\nIdk, some of you all might be close to your relatives and enjoy CNY but to me it's just a mad rush rat race kinda feel, we usually returned to work much more tired than usual day.

      "selftext": "My observation of CNY celebrations (my own family and relatives, and also through visiting other families) over the past few years has made me very curious about how certain local traditions have changed over time... Tech disruption and cost of living have definitely inevitably affected certain habits, but has anyone consciously stopped doing certain things because you decided that they are way too inconvenient or just dont make sense at all?\n\n1. Heard from my colleague that he doesn't bother giving red packets and just Grabpay everyone during visiting...not sure how the elders view it\n\n2. During one of my visits, I presented 2 mandarin oranges to a friend. He scratched his head and said \"aiya actually no need la...now I need to return you 2 oranges right?\" then he spent some time digging through his fridge to find 2 oranges to return to me. It didn't offend me, but it amused me and made me question myself something everyone has been doing for so long\n\n3. Colours and types of clothes during festive seasons. Many complain about the weather and hope for practicality but the elders insist on avoiding old clothes and certain colours. I've actually stopped buying new clothes for CNY for a very long time, but I still try to wear presentable clothes to avoid offending others when visiting\n\n4. Greatly reducing the amount of snacks and decorations bought for festive seasons, in the name of health and reducing environmental waste. My neighbour bought a brand new Xmas tree last year and just threw it out after Xmas ended. I felt like it was a huge waste (besides their improper disposal method)\n\nAre there any other traditional habits you have stopped doing? Non-Chinese friends, you can chip in too! :)\n\nEDIT: Wow thank you to everyone for sharing your thoughts! It's been really enlightening, especially reading about traditions that I'm not familiar with :) Not sure if any of us reading the comments will decide to change or retain any of the habits we've had for the past few years, but all the sharings have been really interesting and thought provoking! :)",

Cold fries, melted ice, and flat soda. We had to throw most of it away.\n\nI understand that CNY is a peak period with fewer riders, but the “cannot cancel” policy when an order is clearly stuck is borderline predatory. It also raises hygiene concerns; if the shop closed at 1 AM and I got the food at 2:45 AM, how long was it sitting out?\n\nHow should platforms like Grab and FP address this?

Once you finish high school studies you can defer for JC/Poly/ITE, or their equivalents (ie the next step after high school)\n\n2. Not during Basic training (BMT) after that YMMV. If its SPF or SCDF, complete no go you'll have to find him a place to stay. They do shift work (2 days on 2 days off). If he is lower than PES A/B1 (PES is the physical standard, any health condition at all guarantees below PES A), then he might not be allowed to stay in depending on where he is posted to. Below PES B1 is basically just admin/office worker and some vocations is literally a 9 to 5. He will need a place to stay, i doubt there can be arrangements made\n\n3. Pretty much, or a hotel maybe\n\n4. I need to preface this with the fact that YOU CANNOT CHOOSE. There is no choice for where you wanna go or what you wanna do. The only way to choose is to properly join the SAF/SPF/SCDF and sign the 5yr bond. Thats the ONLY way to get what you want to go to (and some stuff like commandos wont even let you in unless you were already selected).  They will send you where you are needed, NOT where you wanna go\n\nIn SAF its Commandos/NDU, SPF is SOC, SCDF unsure. Highest rank you can get in NS would be 1LT or NS Inspector for SAF and SPF respectively. But very hard to get into those vocations. Extremely hard, you basically have to be hand picked for Commandos/NDU before you even enlist (they will invite for a vocational assessment before you even receive the enlistment letter). SOC is basically impossible to get without IPPT Gold and acing everything else. Officer ranks also need you to go through the officer courses, which drag training out from 3 months to 9 months, including vocational training it could be up to 12 months (afaik). During which you will only be paid as a officer cadet and not an officer. Not to mention some intakes are \"mono intakes\", which mean they urgently need men to replace those who are about to finish their NS obligations. From what i know in these batches its near impossible to go for leadership courses and he will be stuck as a corporal. Commando/NDU if you're overseas sgrean i am 90% sure you can forget about it. If SPF and you want to get SOC its a 50/50 at best (they only intake from certain cohorts). TLDR you can forget about getting the absolute max pay if you are an overseas sgrean/PR. Max realistically is maybe 900-1k? Sergeant rank. SPF can get more as it has 300 risk pay for most vocations.\n\nIf he is PES B3 or below, can forget about Officer school or risk pay. Best case is just Sergeant but even thats not so common from what i saw\n\n5. Depends on the batch. Jan/Feb/April is JC batch, all nice kids. June-Oct might be Poly/ITE kids, tend to not be as nice. If he tries his best it will be fine. If he is the one constantly causing everyone to get punished i wouldnt be surprised if everyone turns on him. PES B3/4 and below you dont have to worry lol they are just fucking clerks. Downside is you cant get the 2 months reduction in service if you pass IPPT as thats only for PES A/B1.",

          "text": "Firstly, you need to have a good idea of all the places they are coming from. Spend a few nights working late and wander around your home late at night at random intervals. When you spot a cockroach, besides killing it, notice where it's coming from. Also check all your cabinets late at night to see if cockroaches show up in them. They are typically attracted to places closer to food sources so it's usually your kitchen cabinets. If you do find them in cabinets, don't kill them or empty your cabinets yet.\n\nSecondly, order Advion roach gel from online. I don't know the size of your home but the 4-tube pack (around 50-60 SGD) will be more than enough. I recommend avoiding any gel/bait you can find in local supermarkets because believe it or not, they're all useless. (Sprays are only good for manual kills and even then they leave behind residue which is a hazard for babies and pets which you have to clean up after.)\n\nThirdly, having identified all the areas they are spawning, now then is the time to empty any infested cabinets and do a one-time mass cleaning / manual cockroach killing with spray and/or good old slippers. Having done that, you can then squirt tiny, droplet-sized squirts of roach gel in the all places you think roaches are most likely to reappear, especially the pathways you think they frequent (Take care not to use gel in places babies/dogs/cats can reach). **I guarantee if you do this carefully and diligently, you will turn the tide with just 1-2 tubes of Advion with waves of dead roaches in 2 weeks and completely obliterate them within 3 months**. There, I gave you the solution, all that's left to do is execute. (I also heard good things about diatomaceous earth but I cannot vouch for that one because I've never tried it).\n\nOne thing to note: some old flats don't just have a built-in chute problem. They have a vent below the gas stove that allows any leaked ~~methane~~ LPG gas to sink to the floor and pass through. That is an even more direct highway for roaches into your kitchen. If you have that, I recommend gating it with a bit of stainless steel wire screen mesh sealed in place with silicone sealant. Do some research to learn the equipment you will need for this.",

This makes it tough for newer employees to get emplaced (put on permanent roles) as most public agencies operate on strict headcount limits.\n\nWorse, others have to pick up their slack, resulting in burnout.

In my experience, public sector is more busy and private sector. \n\nHowever, the busyness is largely due to inefficiencies rather than a larger amount of meaningful work. I think the root cause is in the culture of treating bosses with too much reverence.\n\nFor example, when helping to staff management in an overseas conference, it is reasonable that the rank and file employee will have to help with admin stuff such as booking flights and to take notes. But in public sector, you have to give choices on the flights and hotels and help them book, even to help them do their online check in. You are expected to list 3 options for breakfast lunch and dinner each day for the boss to decide, then proceed to make reservations. You are expected to suggest possible things to do at night (watch a show etc) even though you would be busy prepping the notes after each day. Worst is when you are expected to suggest who to have meetings with and what to talk about, which I think should at least be the one thing management does. Yes I do think that the bosses at director level and above are big babies. \n\nAnother issue is that there is an irrational fear of not having answers to a question immediately. For each meeting with big bosses (board, permanent secretary, minister etc), you need to come up with “anticipated questions” and their answers. These have to be cleared by many bosses, each adding more and more questions. I have seen a list of anticipated questions that was over 80pages long! We should be prepared for meetings, but the preparation for possible questions should just be on the key points. If things are not core, they should learn to just say that we don’t have the answer now but will get back later. \n\nAnother point to make is about layers of approval. One issue will need clearance from many levels of bosses. And since some issues affect multiple ministries, many many layers of approval (like 20) is needed before it goes to the decision maker. In private sector, it was usually me to the manager then to the boss. Public sector…. Need at least 5 and a lot more if other agencies are involved. Perhaps the stakes are higher because decisions in public sector affect many more people and can affect them more deeply than in private sector. But this all adds up to the workload. A lot more work for one thing to get done. \n\nSo, one reason why people may find public sector work chill is that the output does not appear to be a lot. But for the employees, it may not be chill because lots of work is required for that little output.",

Which place has more expertise with this specific condition?\n- I see lots of people saying the US will have better care. On average, the US tends to rank lower than Singapore in outcomes, but it is highly variable across the country so it depends on which hospital you are sending your kid to. Singapore General Hospital also has been ranking in the top 10 hospitals in the world for a while now (but it doesn’t have pediatrics). Singapore is smaller but does act as a regional centre for rarer diseases (in wealthier patients, as it has better healthcare than surrounding countries. Ultimately, it really depends on the condition, and I would suggest contacting the 2 public hospitals with pediatrics departments (National University Hospital, KK Hospital) to find out who your son would be seeing and what equipment/treatment they have that your son would require\n2. How are you financing his care?\n- Healthcare in Singapore is generally more affordable than in the US, especially for Singapore citizens so applyjng for citizenship is definitely a good idea. This kind of mitochondrial genetic disease will be lifelong so it’s worth considering if he will be covered by insurance in the long term. There could be lots of unexpected costs even if you think paying for treatment is financially viable in the short term. If he did not already have private health insurance before this, it will be hard to get it now. So the mandatory insurance system in Singapore could be quite helpful in this case\n\nThe other issues you raised probably won’t be an issue. His access to healthcare will be fine, especially as a patient with a more serious condition. School in Singapore is more stressful &amp; rigorous than that in the US. If he ends up with some level of intellectual disability, I would recommend staying in the US instead as our special needs programs are not quite as developed. NS should be fine, he will get a reduced PES status meaning that he will not need to do strenuous physical activity if he is limited by his condition (eg he might end up in an admin/desk job)",

He’s the sweetest guy, super hardworking, and I love him to bits. Yesterday was the first time I went to his place for CNY reunion dinner. For context, I know that my family and his family has some SES differences, but I haven’t been bothered by it until yesterday.\n\nMy family stays in a landed home in District X. I knew he stayed in a 3-room HDB , but seeing it in person was a total culture shock.\n\nThe moment I stepped in, I felt so out of place. The house was so cramped, and the smell of cooking oil was everywhere because the kitchen is right next to the living room. His parents don't speak a word of English, only very loud, broken Hokkien/Mandarin.\n\nI tried my best to smile and use my limited Hokkien to communicate with them. I wanted to make a good impression, so I really dressed up. I wore a modest designer cheongsam (the lace one from SC brand) with some jewellery.\n\nI thought I looked respectful and  proper for the elders. However, this has bad fired badly. His dad was quite uncouth... throughout dinner, he kept staring at me. He made some comments in Hokkien like, \"Wah, your gf so 'swee,' body also very 'tok kong.' You better faster make her pregnant so she don't run away.\" Then he winked and made some hand gestures that made me feel so violated. Everyone else (including his siblings and mum) laughed like it was a normal joke, even my BF just chuckled and told him to eat more. I felt so cheap.\n\nNow I’m caught in a dilemma. I love my BF, but I’m thinking about our future. If we get married, my parents (who are very refined/particular about etiquette) have to sit across the table from a man who makes sexual jokes about his own daughter-in-law? I duno how both of our families can mingle in future. Now I feel so naive for thinking \"love conquers all.\" Is this what life is going to be like? Am I being a classist snob for being bothered by the 3-room flat and the lack of manners, or am I right to be scared? Please don't roast me as an entitled princess as I’m already feeling like trash, so appreciate constructive comments and advice to help me clear my mind.",

Most people in SG ~are~ (or say they are) in monogamous relationships, and I'd imagine most of your bf's friends are too. So it'd be interesting to see if they'd be OK with their own gf or wife stepping outside their marriage and rubbing up other men even if there is no penetration and since it's \"all just physical, there's no emotions or feelings involved\" lor. (The answer is, most probably not, because double standards.)\n\nUltimately, it's between just you and your bf to decide, define and maintain the boundaries of your two's own relationship. Whether it's OK for one person to go to such lup sup places and if go, maximum can only drink and lap dance etc; or cannot go entirely.

The father’s heart-wrenching cries at the scene moved people across the island to grief for the family’s loss.\n\nYet even before police investigations were completed, social media had already launched a trial by public opinion against the driver. Some netizens narrated the incident in a tone resembling that of eyewitnesses, layering on vivid “details” through speculation and conjecture. In the process, they swiftly labeled the driver as “CECA.”\n\n“CECA” is the abbreviation for the Singapore–India Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement. In online discourse, it is also used to refer to new immigrants from India.\n\nAlthough those conducting this online trial may represent only a vocal minority, it is worth asking: when faced with such a heartbreaking accident, why do some people’s first instinct is to vent dissatisfaction toward a particular community?\n\nIt cannot be denied that the anger some netizens direct at “CECA” may reflect deeper anxieties—long-standing unease about immigration policies, social integration, and perceived disruptions to local ways of life. Such emotions deserve to be acknowledged, but they must not be expressed in this manner.\n\nIt should also be emphasized that the police have acted. The 38-year-old female driver has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by negligent driving. Claims that the authorities would “let CECA off the hook” are entirely baseless and serve only to inflame social divisions.\n\nAnother point of controversy concerns eyewitness accounts alleging that the driver, while speaking to the girl’s father at the scene, raised her voice and made a palm-up gesture while explaining herself. Some netizens interpreted this as arrogance or an attempt to shirk responsibility.\n\nThe Swiss-American psychiatrist Elisabeth Kübler-Ross proposed the “Five Stages of Grief” model to describe how people respond to death or severe trauma. Three of these stages are denial, anger, and bargaining. This framework may, at times, help explain the behavior of those involved in traumatic incidents.\n\nI was not at the scene, nor do I know any of the individuals involved. I have no intention of excusing negligent driving. However, the driver’s behavior at the accident scene might be interpreted through this lens.\n\nAs for what punishment she should receive, that must be determined by the law—not by destroying her character based solely on her identity, tone, or body language.\n\nAt the time of writing, the deceased has been laid to rest, and the injured remains hospitalized. May the departed rest in peace, may the injured recover swiftly, and may our society show a little more understanding and a little less hatred—so that emotional outbursts do not overshadow thoughtful reflection on the incident and accountability for it.\"",

The risk about diy is it might get contested in law should there be disagreement among the beneficiaries (or even non beneficiaries who feel they should be beneficiaries) of what you really mean in your Will, esp if they are not straightforward, or whether you were of sound mind when you wrote the Will. As my kids are still young (as is yours), my Will also includes a testamentary trust which my executor will need to enforce, that is, only a certain sum of living expenses is taken out from my estate annually for my minor children, until they reach a certain age then the remaining funds will be distributed to them).\n\nAnother thing you didn't mention is CPF nominations.

Cash gets held as collateral while the CPF monies are being invested, then refunded after settlement. Takes longer to settle trades (T+5 working days) as opposed to Endowus.\n\n**Endowus**: carries the fund, no collateral requirement since CPF funds are drawn directly from CPF Board. But the I'm paying \\~0.35% all-in, which is like 7x the fund's own expense ratio just in platform fees.\n\nMy concern with POEMS is that I don't keep a large cash buffer by choice. I'd rather have my cash deployed instead of sitting as collateral for a CPFIS order, because that’s cash I can't use to buy opportunistically in IBKR. Other than that, the collateral window is only a few days but having a longer settlement period during market downturns actually matters to me. There’s also the matter of the minimum investment size which causes odd lots in POEMS, but that’s another topic.\n\nAm I missing anything that carry Amundi funds for CPFIS? And for those of you on Endowus for CPFIS, do you just accept the 0.30% as the price of convenience, or have you found a way around it?\n\n**EDIT**: Thanks everyone for the updates!

Over a long period of time, I am surprised that CPF balance can be quite substantial. It doesn't feel much on a month by month basis but if you work for a long time, it can be significant.\n2. FRS will continue to grow and hence this is something to take note of. \n3. For BHS cap, if we were to assume that is the amount to target to ensure proper health coverage, it seems quite a challenge to hit it as well i.e. meaning one might have to have cash or insurance to address any unforeseen medical issue.\n4. Reaching FRS is doable but ERS is a different thing. You are likely not going to hit it unless you do active topping up. What are your thoughts? Would you try to go for ERS for the higher monthly payout.\n5. Delay CPF Life payout might increase the payout by a few hundreds but I am not sure if it worth the delay. Would you start your CPF life at 65 or later.\n6. My expense maybe on the high side because I realized CPF Life only contribute to less than 50% of expense. I am not sure if there is so called a \"target\" since everyone life style is different. How much does CPF life payout covers your expenses? I have peers that can cover up to 80% of their expenses.\n\n  \nHope you find this useful and would like to hear your thoughts as well!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lrleibmy9gkg1.png?width=1219&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc3152229a79b7829fa27d042010d8c39b04dede\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xcgnh0v1agkg1.png?width=1226&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d7e2742dfbd748c18aa9d6789172280d3875365\n\n",

          "text": "This is my take on CPF LIFE. \n\nThe scheme is primarily a longevity insurance, with the key point on it being an insurance at the end of the day. People who focus on ‘breakeven’ ages and how to profit the most from it are missing the point - you don’t buy hospitalisation insurance and calculate how many times you have to get warded for it to be worth it, you don’t buy term insurance and say it’s worth if you die before X years old, so you shouldn’t be saying CPF LIFE is worth if you live to Y years old. You ‘buy’ into it for the insurance aspect and not to profit from it (because statistically you will not).\n\nNow while it’s not like term or CI insurance where you can explicitly choose a dollar amount to buy, the choices you have in the scheme determines the coverage of this ‘longevity insurance’. \nNamely, in increasing order of coverage \n1) BRS (pledging property)-&gt; FRS -&gt; ERS\n2) Basic -&gt; standard -&gt; escalating withdrawal plan\n3) how delayed the payouts start after age 65\n\nFor most, BRS to ERS is obvious but why is escalating and delayed considered a higher coverage? Because you’re paying a higher cost now to get a larger future payout (protection), the same way you would pay more for a term insurance with a higher sum assured.\n\nSo if you want the least coverage in this insurance, you go for BRS + basic + immediate start whereas the ‘highest’ coverage (meaning the most protection against living long) would be ERS + escalating + delay to 70.\n\nSo naturally the question is how much coverage do you need? Higher coverage is not always good since you’re paying more for it as well. For term or CI insurance, there are guidelines like 5x income but from what I know CPF doesn’t give much guidance on _how_ to choose between the options, they just present the facts to you and let you decide. \n\nTo me, the higher your net worth the less you need longevity insurance, since the chance you outlive your money pot is smaller. So if you’ve not much saved for retirement, max out CPF and go for the ‘highest’ coverage. Whereas if you have 10M then you really don’t need any longevity insurance and you should go for the minimum.",

At 4% interest rate, your money is doubled after waiting about 18yrs.\n\nThe power of forced savings is amazing too. CPF Board forces us to save 20% of our income, and then my mother forced me to save another 20% of my take-home pay in a 20yr savings endowment plan. Both of these pay relatively low interest rates 2 - 4% but because capital is guaranteed so no complaints. The best benefit here is forced to save up no need to apply self-discipline.\n\nThe above 2 methods of growing wealth are suitable only for people who doesn't take any risks and who doesn't wish to seek greater yields in other investment vehicles.\n\nI am below 55 so currently I only top-up the amount that CPF Board allows me to (8k or less each year) for the purpose of tax relief. I also top-up $15,300 into SRS also for the purpose of tax relief.\n\nOnly after I have fully paid up my flat then I grew a pair of balls (joking lah, I am still an auntie, did not turn into an uncle) and I started learning about stocks, unit trusts and index funds. The balls I grew are not that big, so I did not venture into Cryptocurrency or Options (but hor I have more gutsy real uncle friends who are into these 2 lehhh).\n\nEhh wait, sorry I sidetracked too much already. Back to the question of ERS. Do I think after my 55th birthday I will want to actively top-up CPF RA to hit ERS? In the past, when I only knew 2 methods of growing wealth that time, I will say yes. Now I will say no. Cash is still king, you can decide what you want to invest in freely without restrictions. If you loved Apple you can go buy Apples, if you love Alphabet you can go and buy Alphabets, and, if you can't decide which of the top companies got the most growth potential you can just buy S&amp;P500 index funds.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, CPF Life payout ($1000+) should only form a small portion of retirement income because CPF Life payout is enough to live on but not enough to have a life. Confusing? What I mean is you will have enough sustenance and surely won't die of hunger but you won't have a vibrant existence (imagine no overseas holidays and no regular fancy restaurant meals).\n\nAbout CPF Life payout adequacy and your high expenses, I will reassure you by telling you that you don't need to lose sleep over it because humans are highly adaptable intelligent beings. There is the opposite of \"lifestyle creep/inflation\"; call it \"lifestyle uncreep/deflation\" if you will. I give you 2 real life examples:\n\n1) My father is a gambler (Singapore Pools is his best friend) and saved up $0 of his $5k monthly income. At retirement, all he got is CPF savings because thank you CPF Board stopped him from gambling away CPF RA. He is now retired and living on CPF Life $900/mth. My sister and I help him by paying for his maid's salary and expenses, we don't give him cash because Singapore Pools is still his best friend.\n\n2) My ex-colleague used to live a high life travelling the world, buying luxury goods and eating at fancy restaurant regularly and she also saved up $0 of her I-dunno-how much monthly income. At retirement, she was so worried that she can't survive without work but she had worried for nothing. Now she has adapted to her new lifestyle so well until she recently told me her $1,300/mth CPF Life too much so she will still have balance leftover every month.",

So long as you're always at or above the median income for graduates of your cohort, you will certainly reach FRS in SA - by 40 if you max out BHS by 28. Much earlier if you also topup your SA / do OA transfers (neither are recommended in my opinion due to ringfencing). I personally do not recommend ERS for those with liquid assets of between 1-3M in retirement. It is fine for those with less (meaning they were never able to amass sufficient assets hence hints at lack of ability) or more (ERS is insignificant).\n\nI would not base my retirement income solely on CPF Life: too much concentration risk. My retirement income pillars would likely be: CPF OA (15-20%), CPF Life Basic - BRS (5-10%), rent (20-30%), SRS (10-15%) and cash investments (remainder) and at any time, always 50-100k in cash or equivalent for emergencies. \n\nIt is also important to account for inflation which is why most of my retirement income sources would have some form of inflation peg. CPF Life, even the escalating plan, would see real retirement incomes shrink over 20-30 years (when payouts start at 65 till the likely life expectancy age of 90+ for my cohort).

If you have no income, the Banks will require you to at least pledge 4years of your monthly installment + show proof of eligible financial assets(this amount may vary from bank to bank, and can be as much as 3-4 times of the loan you wish to get). \n\nIf you have an existing mortgage, and it is your only mortgage loan, AND you are residing there, you have more options. You can choose to refinance the loan to another Bank or reprice the loan with the existing Bank. I am assuming this is a private property rather than a HDB given you mentioned is bank.some banks may offer you a lower interest rate package that you can switch to after your lock in period is over. Some banks allow you to switch earlier within the same Bank with repricing. For owner occupied properties, the process is very much more simplified. \n\nHowever, if this is not your only property loan, or it is a home equity loan that you are leveraging on a property you are renting out/investment property, then you face more obstacles to refinance/reprice without income that is recognisable. Most banks require you to go through TDSR (total debt servicing ratio) assessment if so, but if you are willing to pay down 3% of the loan under a Debt reduction plan, you get to skip the TDSR. This applies even if you are repricing within the same Bank and is a regulatory requirement. My concern for you would be if you took this loan back when TDSR was allowed to be higher eg like your mortgage consists of 60% of your gross monthly income then, you might find it difficult to pass the TDSR now if you really want to switch to a lower interest rate package, especially if you don’t have the same amount of recognisable income. You also have the option to keep a portion of money with the Bank (about 4 years of your monthly installment as collateral that you can’t touch) to pass TDSR, but it’s not a sound course, given you can use the funds for other purposes.  Most people also don’t know this, but if the property loan is a housing loan, not an equity term loan, you can try to apply to CPF to use a portion of your OA to pay down the housing loan, even if the property is an investment unit, especially if you have already activated CPF usage for it back when you first bought the property. It would make sense in the event mortgage rates go back above CPF OA rate. \n\nMortgage rate packages also differ from bank to bank and every month or even week could be different, depending on the Bank’s cost of funds. Before you make any decision, you should do your own due diligence. What works for others may not work for your risk appetite.

Technically it was supposed to be a condition that shouldn’t have been covered, hence the insurer rejected the claim  (congenital illness has a 1 year waiting period, 9month old baby has no symptoms at birth + it was a congenital condition that will take a while to surface, and the symptoms only surfaced when she was 9 months old) - but the insurance company ended up covering the costs of the hospitalisation after I went to fidrec. Disclaimer: This is not the full account of the situation, I don’t want to type too much on Reddit so I’m just keeping it concise. \n\nAnyway, just go and contact fidrec if you have to!

SRS seems powerful because withdrawals are spread over just 10 years. If structured properly, it can cover a meaningful portion of living expenses during that window.\n\nWould you plan to fully draw down SRS to zero over those 10 years? Or pace it more conservatively?\n\n1. The timing between SRS and CPF LIFE feels slightly misaligned. SRS penalty-free withdrawals start at 63, but CPF LIFE payouts begin at 65 (earliest). That creates a 2-year gap.\n\nWas this intentional policy design? Or just historical layering of schemes?\n\n1. Because of that timing difference, some retirement years feel more “secure” than others with SRS or CPF LIFE payouts reducing the need for investment drawdowns.\n\nPost-65 looks relatively stable under current policies. The real challenge seems to be retiring earlier (say 55) and bridging the 55–65 gap.\n\nWhich brings me to CPF OA.\n\nHow do you think about managing OA in retirement planning?  \n• Regular withdrawal?  \n• Lump sum withdrawal and invest externally?  \n• Leave it untouched as a conservative buffer?\n\nCurious how others are structuring this?\n\nSeparately, I built a small tool to model CPF LIFE and SRS projections while exploring these questions.

How should I choose them and how was the recommended option chosen? (Also, as a newbie I'm not as familiar with ISPs, riders etc so would be helpful to explain them)\n- how to choose between term and whole life?\n- what to look out for in CI definition? E.g. any specific illnesses\n- would be good to have some explanation on the coverage amounts chosen, or some back of the envelope working. Otherwise it's quite easy for the agent to persuade someone to buy higher coverage \"just in case\"\n- minor point that the tool tips are finicky on mobile (sometimes disappears immediately after clicked)\n\n\nI understand these can be answered by doing some research, but I think it'll be helpful to piece them all together in your website. ",

Since im not Singaporean, my company is paying me what they would pay a Singaporean into a CPF into an SRS account at DBS instead. I would like to put my money to work with US Stocks like GOOG and Irish domiciled ETFs like CSPX or VUAG. I haven't been able to figure out how to do that. Calling, visiting or even meeting with DBS has proven useless. They are interested in talking about selling me super high fee mutual funds or insurance products. I want to self manage and just buy low cost ETFs or stocks. According to my company, I am not allowed to use a different bank for the SRS.\n\n1)  I am told, I might be able to buy US stocks and ETFs in the SRS if I open a DBS Vickers account but no one can confirm for sure, is this the way? Any costs? Is there a better way?\n\n2) Can I move the money from DBS SRS to another SRS that's easier to invest in while keeping the DBS one open so that I can receive new money every month? If so, which bank? Any fees?\n\n3) Anything else I should be aware of? Or things to look out for?\n",

          "text": "The main thing to know is that your SRS account and your brokerage accounts are 2 separate things.\n\n  \nSRS = account where the money sits (think of it as any other bank account). There is no difference where this account sits. They all operate the same way.\n\n  \nBrokerage = account where you can buy stocks / ETFs. DBS Vickers is DBS's version of a brokerage account. The brokerage account provider and SRS account provider do not need to be the same. Also, do not use DBS Vickers for SRS investing as fees are ridiculous. What you can invest in depends on your brokerage account.\n\n  \nSo what you need now is to find a brokerage that can support SRS investing. The most common ones are POEMS and Stashaway. For Singapore, you generally can't find a good way to invest SRS funds into single stocks like GOOG but LSE ETFs are more easily accessible. Typical investments for SRS funds include the Amundi World Unit Trust (similar to SWRD) via POEMs and Amundi US Trust (similar to CSPX I believe) via POEMs. Note that these are Unit Trusts, not ETFs.\n\n\n\nStashway recently introduced a new product called ETF Explorer where you can buy ETFs directly via their platform at a 1 USD fee. You have access to ISAC, which is again similar to SWRD via this route.",

I think there's even a SGD hedged UTone launched by OCBC recently. Infinity U.S. 500 Stock Index Fund (SGD Hedged)\n\nGenerally the banks to invest has higher transaction costs and minimum sum commission than poems or endowus or whatever other brokerages, so most that do this method try to save fees by linkage to other external brokers.\n\nHappy to answer any questions, tho I find it funny that your company can credit into your srs account? Usually for us it salary goes into bank account then we contribute for tax savings.\n\nOther things to look out for is S&amp;P has been more or less flat since year to date.\n\nEmerging markets outperform in the last few months.\n\nYou can even buy physical gold which was the winner in terms of total growth adding div + etf growth under SGX:GLD",
