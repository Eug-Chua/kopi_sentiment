They do not need to pack the trains, it is an infrastructure that is not just speedy, but very comfortable (non air con buses were a thing).\n\nToday, even the dumpster fire that is NEL and NSL could not make them expedite building the Seletar Line. No matter how many people have been lobbying them over the years, they just would not extend JRL to CCL before “2040s”, the same crappy timeline as the long delayed Seletar line.\n\nMRT is just one, but not the only thing, that had regressed as our country got wealthier.\n\nAs we get wealthier, the more quality of life stuff gets cut. MRT becomes more crowded while fares go up. Housing becomes smaller while prices go up. Rental prices so high the only things we get to enjoy are the same old franchises and chains.\n\nFor the older generations, they were so loyal to the government because the wealthier the nation, the better things were.\n\nFor us, the wealthier the nation, the worse things seem to get.

It was never just communication. It was connection.\n\nThose interactions shaped how I thought, how I listened, and how I made decisions, big and small. It made me a better public servant, and I hope, a better person; though I remain deeply flawed.\n\nSo yes, there is a sense of loss.\n\nBut also something else.\n\nA quiet reminder, perhaps, of how little we really hold on to.\n\nSeasons change. Roles end. Much of what we build, even what we treasure, does not stay.\n\nAnd perhaps that is part of the point.\n\nNot everything is meant to be kept.\n\nThese are moments in time.  \nBut memories for a lifetime.\n\nWhat remains are the people, the conversations, and the shared journey.\n\nBeing a public leader was a privilege that I have never taken lightly.

While getting a drink for my friends, I observed a group of youths ordering a jug of red bull vodka and then sharing it. And no, it wasn’t exchanged with complimentary drink coupons because I saw that they paid with their mobile wallet. Inside my head, I was thinking if youths can only afford such drinks nowadays.\n\nI then casually asked if they knew what a Flaming Lamborghini was. They looked at each other, and then back at me, shaking their head and all puzzled.\n\n“Well you’re about to find out”. I then proceeded to buy them a Flaming Lamborghini each.\n\nThe staff there was also stunned at the order. It seemed as if he hadn’t prepared the drink in a long time. His senior came and then showed him how it was done.\n\nWhen the drink was served, I showed them how it was drunk. “Everything at once! No stopping” before I sipped it all down with the fire.\n\nThey were so fascinated and amazed at that moment. I probably unlocked a core memory for them all. \n\nAfter the drinks, I looked at them and told them casually “This is what me and my friends used to drink every time we clubbed last time.”\n\nI then foot the bill and left them to party. It was like $45 a pop (after service charge and GST) so it ended up being around $200+. It used to be $28 or so and there was like 1-1 promo so probably $14 each.\n\nSo yeah, it’s expensive no shit.

Tech disruption and cost of living have definitely inevitably affected certain habits, but has anyone consciously stopped doing certain things because you decided that they are way too inconvenient or just dont make sense at all?\n\n1. Heard from my colleague that he doesn't bother giving red packets and just Grabpay everyone during visiting...not sure how the elders view it\n\n2. During one of my visits, I presented 2 mandarin oranges to a friend. He scratched his head and said \"aiya actually no need la...now I need to return you 2 oranges right?\" then he spent some time digging through his fridge to find 2 oranges to return to me. It didn't offend me, but it amused me and made me question myself something everyone has been doing for so long\n\n3. Colours and types of clothes during festive seasons. Many complain about the weather and hope for practicality but the elders insist on avoiding old clothes and certain colours. I've actually stopped buying new clothes for CNY for a very long time, but I still try to wear presentable clothes to avoid offending others when visiting\n\n4. Greatly reducing the amount of snacks and decorations bought for festive seasons, in the name of health and reducing environmental waste. My neighbour bought a brand new Xmas tree last year and just threw it out after Xmas ended. I felt like it was a huge waste (besides their improper disposal method)\n\nAre there any other traditional habits you have stopped doing? Non-Chinese friends, you can chip in too! :)\n\nEDIT: Wow thank you to everyone for sharing your thoughts!

Cold fries, melted ice, and flat soda. We had to throw most of it away.\n\nI understand that CNY is a peak period with fewer riders, but the “cannot cancel” policy when an order is clearly stuck is borderline predatory. It also raises hygiene concerns; if the shop closed at 1 AM and I got the food at 2:45 AM, how long was it sitting out?\n\nHow should platforms like Grab and FP address this?

          "text": "Firstly, you need to have a good idea of all the places they are coming from. Spend a few nights working late and wander around your home late at night at random intervals. When you spot a cockroach, besides killing it, notice where it's coming from. Also check all your cabinets late at night to see if cockroaches show up in them. They are typically attracted to places closer to food sources so it's usually your kitchen cabinets. If you do find them in cabinets, don't kill them or empty your cabinets yet.\n\nSecondly, order Advion roach gel from online. I don't know the size of your home but the 4-tube pack (around 50-60 SGD) will be more than enough. I recommend avoiding any gel/bait you can find in local supermarkets because believe it or not, they're all useless. (Sprays are only good for manual kills and even then they leave behind residue which is a hazard for babies and pets which you have to clean up after.)\n\nThirdly, having identified all the areas they are spawning, now then is the time to empty any infested cabinets and do a one-time mass cleaning / manual cockroach killing with spray and/or good old slippers. Having done that, you can then squirt tiny, droplet-sized squirts of roach gel in the all places you think roaches are most likely to reappear, especially the pathways you think they frequent (Take care not to use gel in places babies/dogs/cats can reach). **I guarantee if you do this carefully and diligently, you will turn the tide with just 1-2 tubes of Advion with waves of dead roaches in 2 weeks and completely obliterate them within 3 months**. There, I gave you the solution, all that's left to do is execute. (I also heard good things about diatomaceous earth but I cannot vouch for that one because I've never tried it).\n\nOne thing to note: some old flats don't just have a built-in chute problem. They have a vent below the gas stove that allows any leaked ~~methane~~ LPG gas to sink to the floor and pass through. That is an even more direct highway for roaches into your kitchen. If you have that, I recommend gating it with a bit of stainless steel wire screen mesh sealed in place with silicone sealant. Do some research to learn the equipment you will need for this.",

Once you finish high school studies you can defer for JC/Poly/ITE, or their equivalents (ie the next step after high school)\n\n2. Not during Basic training (BMT) after that YMMV. If its SPF or SCDF, complete no go you'll have to find him a place to stay. They do shift work (2 days on 2 days off). If he is lower than PES A/B1 (PES is the physical standard, any health condition at all guarantees below PES A), then he might not be allowed to stay in depending on where he is posted to. Below PES B1 is basically just admin/office worker and some vocations is literally a 9 to 5. He will need a place to stay, i doubt there can be arrangements made\n\n3. Pretty much, or a hotel maybe\n\n4. I need to preface this with the fact that YOU CANNOT CHOOSE. There is no choice for where you wanna go or what you wanna do. The only way to choose is to properly join the SAF/SPF/SCDF and sign the 5yr bond. Thats the ONLY way to get what you want to go to (and some stuff like commandos wont even let you in unless you were already selected).  They will send you where you are needed, NOT where you wanna go\n\nIn SAF its Commandos/NDU, SPF is SOC, SCDF unsure. Highest rank you can get in NS would be 1LT or NS Inspector for SAF and SPF respectively. But very hard to get into those vocations. Extremely hard, you basically have to be hand picked for Commandos/NDU before you even enlist (they will invite for a vocational assessment before you even receive the enlistment letter). SOC is basically impossible to get without IPPT Gold and acing everything else. Officer ranks also need you to go through the officer courses, which drag training out from 3 months to 9 months, including vocational training it could be up to 12 months (afaik). During which you will only be paid as a officer cadet and not an officer. Not to mention some intakes are \"mono intakes\", which mean they urgently need men to replace those who are about to finish their NS obligations. From what i know in these batches its near impossible to go for leadership courses and he will be stuck as a corporal. Commando/NDU if you're overseas sgrean i am 90% sure you can forget about it. If SPF and you want to get SOC its a 50/50 at best (they only intake from certain cohorts). TLDR you can forget about getting the absolute max pay if you are an overseas sgrean/PR. Max realistically is maybe 900-1k? Sergeant rank. SPF can get more as it has 300 risk pay for most vocations.\n\nIf he is PES B3 or below, can forget about Officer school or risk pay. Best case is just Sergeant but even thats not so common from what i saw\n\n5. Depends on the batch. Jan/Feb/April is JC batch, all nice kids. June-Oct might be Poly/ITE kids, tend to not be as nice. If he tries his best it will be fine. If he is the one constantly causing everyone to get punished i wouldnt be surprised if everyone turns on him. PES B3/4 and below you dont have to worry lol they are just fucking clerks. Downside is you cant get the 2 months reduction in service if you pass IPPT as thats only for PES A/B1.",

Work often extends beyond standard office hours, sometimes into weekends. Many of us are contactable after hours via email and WhatsApp, and there’s an ongoing sense of being on standby in case issues escalate. Mentally, it can feel difficult to fully disconnect, even during festive periods.\n\nI’m hoping to hear perspectives from others (both within and outside the public sector in Singapore):\n\n\t•\tAre there specific job functions within the public sector that genuinely have better work-life balance?\n\n\t•\tDo “chiller” roles typically come with significantly lower pay, or are there roles that still offer competitive compensation relative to age/experience?\n\n\t•\tFor those in high-intensity public sector roles, how do you manage burnout and maintain a positive outlook?\n\n\t•\tHow do you personally assess the impact or value of the work you do,especially when faced with large number of amendments from bosses for written work?\n\n\t•\tWhy do you think the stereotype of public servants having relaxed jobs persists over the years?\n\nWould appreciate thoughtful insights.",

And people who are there for 20/30 years even though theyve practically given up on their careers and do basically the bare minimum.\n\nPub sector can be intense sometimes, sure, but I think it doesnt come close to some of the top private sector companies that squueze every last drop out of you while keeping your job stability hostage.

The most frustrating thing for them (and I work with some 20 public service agencies) is that goalposts are always changing because some senior director comes up with a new smart idea last minute. Complete overhaul of specs last minute leaving project teams scrambling is a very common phenomenon. This is very demoralizing because you have officers working for months and suddenly a FYI presentation to senior management just sent all the hard work down the drain. Eg, a project I worked on for 6 months was close to completion and the mgmt just wanted to update the minister in charge. Minister asked some questions about the project which clearly showed he didn't understand the project background and had mixed up the agencies' portfolios. But instead of explaining the rationale for the constraints, the project scope expanded and became cross-agency to cater for the minister's requests and yet had to be delivered within the remaining 4 weeks.

In my experience, public sector is more busy and private sector. \n\nHowever, the busyness is largely due to inefficiencies rather than a larger amount of meaningful work. I think the root cause is in the culture of treating bosses with too much reverence.\n\nFor example, when helping to staff management in an overseas conference, it is reasonable that the rank and file employee will have to help with admin stuff such as booking flights and to take notes. But in public sector, you have to give choices on the flights and hotels and help them book, even to help them do their online check in. You are expected to list 3 options for breakfast lunch and dinner each day for the boss to decide, then proceed to make reservations. You are expected to suggest possible things to do at night (watch a show etc) even though you would be busy prepping the notes after each day. Worst is when you are expected to suggest who to have meetings with and what to talk about, which I think should at least be the one thing management does. Yes I do think that the bosses at director level and above are big babies. \n\nAnother issue is that there is an irrational fear of not having answers to a question immediately. For each meeting with big bosses (board, permanent secretary, minister etc), you need to come up with “anticipated questions” and their answers. These have to be cleared by many bosses, each adding more and more questions. I have seen a list of anticipated questions that was over 80pages long! We should be prepared for meetings, but the preparation for possible questions should just be on the key points. If things are not core, they should learn to just say that we don’t have the answer now but will get back later. \n\nAnother point to make is about layers of approval. One issue will need clearance from many levels of bosses. And since some issues affect multiple ministries, many many layers of approval (like 20) is needed before it goes to the decision maker. In private sector, it was usually me to the manager then to the boss. Public sector…. Need at least 5 and a lot more if other agencies are involved. Perhaps the stakes are higher because decisions in public sector affect many more people and can affect them more deeply than in private sector. But this all adds up to the workload. A lot more work for one thing to get done. \n\nSo, one reason why people may find public sector work chill is that the output does not appear to be a lot. But for the employees, it may not be chill because lots of work is required for that little output.",

This makes it tough for newer employees to get emplaced (put on permanent roles) as most public agencies operate on strict headcount limits.\n\nWorse, others have to pick up their slack, resulting in burnout. In public sector, the maxim that good performers are rewarded with more work definitely applies.\n\nEnd of the day, especially at more senior levels, public sector pay is generally low enough (unless one is receiving PSL or AO allowance) that the salary to workload ratio cannot be what keeps one going, regardless if one is cruising.",

          "text": "As someone in healthcare, I think there are 2 important questions:\n1. Which place has more expertise with this specific condition?\n- I see lots of people saying the US will have better care. On average, the US tends to rank lower than Singapore in outcomes, but it is highly variable across the country so it depends on which hospital you are sending your kid to. Singapore General Hospital also has been ranking in the top 10 hospitals in the world for a while now (but it doesn’t have pediatrics). Singapore is smaller but does act as a regional centre for rarer diseases (in wealthier patients, as it has better healthcare than surrounding countries. Ultimately, it really depends on the condition, and I would suggest contacting the 2 public hospitals with pediatrics departments (National University Hospital, KK Hospital) to find out who your son would be seeing and what equipment/treatment they have that your son would require\n2. How are you financing his care?\n- Healthcare in Singapore is generally more affordable than in the US, especially for Singapore citizens so applyjng for citizenship is definitely a good idea. This kind of mitochondrial genetic disease will be lifelong so it’s worth considering if he will be covered by insurance in the long term. There could be lots of unexpected costs even if you think paying for treatment is financially viable in the short term. If he did not already have private health insurance before this, it will be hard to get it now. So the mandatory insurance system in Singapore could be quite helpful in this case\n\nThe other issues you raised probably won’t be an issue. His access to healthcare will be fine, especially as a patient with a more serious condition. School in Singapore is more stressful &amp; rigorous than that in the US. If he ends up with some level of intellectual disability, I would recommend staying in the US instead as our special needs programs are not quite as developed. NS should be fine, he will get a reduced PES status meaning that he will not need to do strenuous physical activity if he is limited by his condition (eg he might end up in an admin/desk job)",

Gender ratios always skewed. Always more guys than gals (estimate 80-20 ratio), which made it uncomfortable for everyone as there'd be minimum 4 guys swarming around 1 gal. What made it even worse was the more attractive ones would often be swamped which made them feel overwhelmed and those who weren't getting any attention were rightfully miffed\n\n2. No facilitation by host/organiser. Using the swarming example, a good host/organiser would step in and redistribute the pax but nothing was done. No facilitation either or if any facilitation done, not much thought was put into how to actually get participants to interact in a meaningful manner\n\n3. Poor venue setup. Most of the events comprised sitdown tables and chairs, which are only helpful for e.g. speed dating or if the organiser/host is facilitating by moving people around. So you would have people hogging the chairs and tables and refusing to move while others stood around hovering behind others - very uncomfortable\n\n4. Most crucially, host/organiser seemed to just want to earn money from the event while preying on the optimism or hope of participants but not doing anything productive. Why I say so is that the event format was still the same each time, despite feedback given to the organiser, which meant the issues mentioned above were recurring. Yet because the participants were hopeful to meet someone, they just kept coming for the events, which means the previous events weren't effective at connecting people romantically and which also means the organiser/host has a captive audience to exploit and profit from",

So really, an IRL version of today’s dating app (I’m assuming?)\n\nThe socials were super fun and I made a whole bunch of friends that were regulars to these things and so we’d hang out even after the event. I think my takeaways from it are that it IS possible to make friends and have the potential for it to organically become something more. One of my good friends today is someone I met there all those years ago. But I think the key is not to expect your prince or princess to appear in the doorway like a movie.\n\nIn the end I met my now husband on a dating app even though ironically I started going for those events because I was super sick of the apps at the time.",

It's a numbers game. Your match with someone is not really based entirely off stats/requirements. You meet people so you know if there's any real attraction and connection. You cannot get this from online.\n\nOnline is skewed to work primarily for women, and for more attractive people who are really only into it for situationships.\n\nYour best bet is just meeting a ton of people and seeing if you can make a connection. It might not happen, and that's fine. The point is to deal with the numbers portion of it. If you don't do that, you're climbing a near-insurmountable hill.\n\nIf I were still single, I'd definitely do singles mixers. Back then, I did the hardest thing possible, which was cold pickups.

At the very least, I’d get to see how these things work.\n\nIMO, it was badly organised and a complete waste of money.\n\nIt was at a two-storey shophouse turned into a clubhouse, KTV on the first floor, pool table upstairs. Turnout was over 100 people, and from what I saw, there were more women than men.\n\nThe format was simple. You fill in a survey, answer a like or dislike personality question, take a Polaroid, and they print a kind of resume profile. Everything gets pasted on a wall for everyone to browse.\n\nThe only complimentary drinks were Oatside milk and bottled green tea. Wine was $6 or $8 a glass. That was it.\n\nThe founder attempted an icebreaker. We were split into groups and made to answer trivia questions like “What’s the capital of Brazil?” Then the organiser announced which team won and… that was the end of it. No follow-up, no actual interaction. Ice thoroughly unbroken. Like HUH? What ICE? \n\nSo I did what I usually do in social situations. I went around and spoke to anyone and everyone. I wasn’t there with a specific agenda or type in mind. The resumes were actually useful conversation starters, but you cannot just rely on 1 sentence to continue a conversation. I remembered one of the girls had a ‘I made this outfit I’m currently wearing from a workshop!’ \n\nBut it felt like most people were there with a clear end goal. Fair enough, it’s a dating event. Still, many conversations ended abruptly, or people drifted off mid-chat to find someone else.\n\nI spoke to a police officer, two tech bros, an early childhood educator, two guys of questionable background, and a medical researcher who also does part-time modelling. Ironically, he was the only person I ended up exchanging contacts with. Everyone else didn’t seem keen to continue the conversation.\n\nThe saddest part was observing a few guys who clearly weren’t socially comfortable. Some looked fresh out of NS. They stood around alone, drink in hand, scanning the room and waiting for someone to approach them. It was hard to watch.\n\nAt one point I suggested to the organiser that maybe she could host more actively. She said the idea was to let people mingle organically. Personally, if I’m charging $48 a head, I’d structure the experience a lot more intentionally. If I’m paying that amount to do essentially nothing, I can think of better ways to spend it. It reeks of poor organising IMO, if I had wanted to just do an event like this it’s really not that hard. \n\nWhat surprised me, though, was overhearing a woman sincerely thanking the organiser and saying she really enjoyed the event. So clearly, it works for some people.\n\nThe medical researcher-model guy, who was probably the most conventionally attractive person there, ended up leaving alone too. I found that oddly amusing.\n\nMy friend, who dragged me there, eventually said it was too overwhelming for him as an introvert and disappeared. I was like, bro, you invited me.\n\nI left feeling bored overall. But if you’re into social anthropology, it would have been a fascinating case study. Watching who approaches, who waits, who performs confidence, who actually connects, and who doesn’t. That part was interesting? \n\nWould I go again? Probably not. I get better social experiences from events I intentionally want to go for and my own events that I host for communities.",

Personally, as a monogamous person, I'd consider going to KTV as cheating even if it was just \"touching only\". Most people in SG ~are~ (or say they are) in monogamous relationships, and I'd imagine most of your bf's friends are too. So it'd be interesting to see if they'd be OK with their own gf or wife stepping outside their marriage and rubbing up other men even if there is no penetration and since it's \"all just physical, there's no emotions or feelings involved\" lor. (The answer is, most probably not, because double standards.)\n\nUltimately, it's between just you and your bf to decide, define and maintain the boundaries of your two's own relationship. Whether it's OK for one person to go to such lup sup places and if go, maximum can only drink and lap dance etc; or cannot go entirely. And if either of you fall short, then reconsider the relationship especially for the sake of your sexual and mental health.",

          "text": "The important question to ask yourself is, \"How it makes you feel?\".\n\nDon't need to let society dictates what should and should not be normal and acceptable.\n\nIf he does something that you don't like, or makes you feel bad, you need to share your feelings with him. \n\nEven if everyone does it, so long as it affects how you feel, both of you need to discuss and deal with it. \n\nEither you allow him to continue and you learn how to cope with the jealousy and negative energy, or he changes his habits and respect your emotions and take responsibility for his actions.\n\nBoth of you decide what kind of relationship both of you want. \n\nMaybe his circle of friends all thinks its ok, maybe their wives also feel that way, but that social pressure should not dictate what you should accept.\n\nI have friends who have kids, but both husband and wife agree to open relationship. Is that normal? Maybe for them. I just asked him a simple question, what if his kids learn about their agreement in the future? \n\nIs that the kind of environment and role model he wish to set for his kids? He just lowered his head and didnt say anything. I just told him I'm not saying what is right or wrong, I'm just asking questions to guide his thoughts. \n\nSometimes what they do might not reflect with how they feel. But they dont know how to cope with stress, all kinds, and just find an easy way out. \n\nSome marriage is just for convenience, husband give money and wife dont care about anything. \n\nSo no point going around asking what others are doing and mimic them. \n\nDecide what kind of relationship you want, decide how you wish to be treated, and decide what kind of future you want. \n\nI can share personally, that I am a man, and I frequent such places when I was single. I stopped when I have a girlfriend. \n\nWhenever I quarrel with my 1st girlfriend, it is very easy to just spend an evening in KTV to feel better. Same goes when I am having a bad day. \n\nAfter awhile, I realised my relationship with my 1st girlfriend isn't healthy. When I have a bad day and I tell her about it, she should try and make me feel better. I should want to find her whenever I feel stress. \n\nI am not suggesting total reliance. But as your partner, both should support one another. I feel the relationship was not balanced, or rather, I feel it was not healthy for me. Saying nice things and making each other life should be reciprocal. Mutual social reliance. \n\nAnother thing is that the bond you create with your male friends, brother brothers, is difficult to replicate outside KTV. It's like army bond, but the negative kind.\n\nWhen I got my 2nd girlfriend, I stopped going casually entirely. They still invited me for special occasion birthday celebration, I still attend but I don't call any girl. \n\nBut with my 2nd girlfriend, I dont feel the urge or need to call for KTV girls. All I can think of is how she would feel if she found out I was hugging another girl. \n\nDont get me wrong, the temptation was still very strong. The girls in KTV are dressed to kill. Their makeup and figure all are specifically chosen to entice the man. And they know their way around men. \n\nWhat kind of man like what kind of personality. And they are super willing to do this service, because they are getting paid and only have to do it for a few hours. Imagine having to please your men non stop, say nice things and be totally demure. It's exhausting I would imagine. \n\nAs for the dabao to hotel, I feel that's basically cheating. Like sexual relationship with any girl other than my girlfriend should be considered that. \n\nYou need to talk with him, how long and often he needs it. How he likes it. How big is his appetite. Try your best to fulfil his needs. \n\nAs long as you communicate and do these things, it should not be difficult. \n\nI told my girlfriend, if whenever and whoever needs it, they just have to communicate and the other needs to be there. No questions asked. \n\nSo try and find someone more in tune with your needs. If 1 is special manic and needs it daily, the other is 1 time per month, the relationship bound to have cheating. \n\nMaybe love could overcome it, make the person who needs daily or 1 time monthly to change habit. But I would say it is easier to find someone suitable. Make your life easier.",

I don't understand why need to drag religion into it. \n\nI have been to many acclaimed restaurants only to feel underwhelmed and cannot understand the price premium and accolades. But it doesn't mean that the food is bad, just that it is not my taste. \n\nThe fact is that operating under the bazaar type environment will inevitably lead to food of not that high quality. Similar to bak kwa sold during CNY and why I never buy bak kea during CNY. \n\nThe reason there is a banner like that is probably due to the fact that if more and more people talk about how overpriced and not good the food is in such bazaar, then less stores will be opened in the next one organised. Ultimately the interest of the bazaar organisers are affected. \n\nThe solution to this whole incident is relatively simple, the rental for the land usage to be reduced to the bare minimum and by regulation, once an organiser has successfully bidded for the usage to have a rental margin of no more than 20%. If the initial price is low enough then the stores coming in will not have to charge such high prices or can increase the food quality, the bad reviews would still be present but the crowds would then make their own judgement. \n\nThe problem is the entire government thinks that they are Goldman Sachs and use market price principles as their basis without any accountability tied to market. So all kena squeezed down the value chain. When the bidding process is the type of highest bidder wins means that the entire experience will likely be expensive. \n\nWe can experiment on the basis of the bidding based on the lowest bid with clear pricing of store rentals, food unit prices and then maybe we can see the difference it brings. \n\nFor clarity, I don't go to these places as I don't like crowds but the way prices are charged for things like potatoes and small beef cubes are crazy imo. \n\nThe government cannot want it all, they want the festive spirit but want to make money from the land usage. They want affordable but want to charge for everything. This is like a gold digging bitch like the Chinese say, 既要又要还要。Where got this type of thing in the world one?",

It handles CPF, SRS, progressive tax, HDB/property, healthcare costs, 12 withdrawal strategies, Monte Carlo simulation, historical backtesting since 1928, and sequence risk stress testing. No login required. Everything runs in your browser — your financial data never leaves your device. It will always be free and it's [open source on GitHub](https://github.com/RemarkRemedy/fireplanner). Still actively fixing bugs and implementing new features — if you spot anything off, let me know!\n\nHey r/singaporefi,\n\nI've been working on a retirement planning tool built specifically for Singapore, and I wanted to share it with the community.\n\n**The problem:** Most FIRE calculators are US-centric. They don't understand CPF, SRS tax deductions, BSD/ABSD, Bala's Table leasehold decay, or SG progressive tax brackets. I wanted something that actually models how retirement planning works *here*.\n\n# What it does\n\n[sgfireplanner.com](https://sgfireplanner.com) is a comprehensive FIRE planner tailored to Singapore residents.\n\n**Singapore-specific modelling**\n\n* **CPF** — age-bracket contribution rates, OA/SA/MA tracking, extra interest on first $60K, BRS/FRS/ERS projections, CPF LIFE payouts\n* **SRS** — tax deduction impact, balance tracking, drawdown planning\n* **Income tax** — SG progressive brackets (0%–24%), personal reliefs (earned income, NSman, spouse, child, parent, CPF, SRS)\n* **Property** — BSD/ABSD calculations, Bala's Table leasehold decay, LTV, HDB monetisation strategies, downsizing analysis\n* **Healthcare** — MediShield Life, Integrated Shield Plans, CareShield LIFE, out-of-pocket cost projections by age\n\n**Income &amp; expense modelling**\n\n* 3 salary projection models (simple, career-phase, MOM data-driven benchmarks)\n* Multiple income streams (salary, rental, dividends, business, CPF LIFE)\n* Life events (promotions, career breaks, parent support obligations)\n* Year-by-year projection table showing exactly how your finances evolve\n\n**Simulation &amp; stress testing**\n\n* **Monte Carlo simulation** — 10,000 randomised market scenarios with 3 methods (parametric, historical bootstrap, fat-tail Student-t)\n* **Historical backtesting** — test your plan against every rolling window since 1928 (97 years of actual market data)\n* **Sequence risk stress testing** — see how your plan holds up under 8 historical crises (GFC, Asian Financial Crisis, COVID crash, etc.) with mitigation strategies (bond tent, cash buffer, flexible spending)\n\n**12 withdrawal strategies — way beyond the 4% rule**\n\n* Constant Dollar (4% Rule), Variable Percentage (VPW), Guardrails (Guyton-Klinger), Vanguard Dynamic, CAPE-Based, Floor &amp; Ceiling, Percent of Portfolio, 1/N Remaining Years, Sensible Withdrawals, 95% Rule, Endowment (Yale), and Hebeler Autopilot II\n* Side-by-side comparison so you can see how each performs\n\n**8 asset classes**\n\n* US Equities, SG Equities (STI), International (MSCI), Bonds, REITs, Gold, Cash, CPF\n* Pre-built allocation templates or build your own\n* Correlation matrix, Markowitz portfolio stats, glide path configuration\n\n**Dashboard &amp; other features**\n\n* FIRE number, progress tracking, years to FIRE\n* \"What if\" analysis, one-more-year impact\n* Risk assessment across 6 dimensions\n* Passive income breakdown for post-retirement\n* 3 onboarding pathways (goal-first, story-first, already FIRE)\n* Simple and Advanced modes — start simple, go deep when ready\n* JSON export/import, Excel export\n* Comprehensive reference guide with ELI5 explanations\n* Retirement preparation checklist\n\n# A note on accuracy\n\nFull transparency — this was vibe-coded with the help of [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code). The formulas are based on official sources (CPF Board, IRAS, URA, MOM) and I've eyeballed the numbers to check that the math looks right, but I haven't formally audited every calculation path. If you spot anything that looks off — a CPF rate that's wrong, a tax bracket that doesn't match, a simulation result that seems fishy — please let me know. Bug reports and corrections are genuinely appreciated and will help make this more reliable for everyone.\n\n# Privacy\n\nThis is a fully client-side app. There is no backend server, no database, no user accounts, and no tracking. All computation runs in your browser using a Web Worker. Your financial data is stored in your browser's localStorage and never transmitted anywhere. You can verify this yourself — the network tab will show zero data being sent.\n\n# Always free. Open source.\n\nThis will always be **free**. No premium tier, no paywalls, no \"sign up for advanced features.\" I built this because I wanted a proper tool for my own planning, and I believe everyone in Singapore should have access to comprehensive retirement planning without paying for it.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nI'm not a financial advisor and this tool is not financial advice. It's built for educational and planning purposes only — to help you explore scenarios and understand how different assumptions affect your retirement projections.\n\n# Feedback welcome\n\nI'd really appreciate any feedback that can make this more useful — whether it's a feature you wish it had, a UX improvement, or a bug. Drop a comment here or DM me. This is very much a community tool, and I want it to serve the community well.\n\n**Link:** [sgfireplanner.com](https://sgfireplanner.com)",

Cash gets held as collateral while the CPF monies are being invested, then refunded after settlement. Takes longer to settle trades (T+5 working days) as opposed to Endowus.\n\n**Endowus**: carries the fund, no collateral requirement since CPF funds are drawn directly from CPF Board. But the I'm paying \\~0.35% all-in, which is like 7x the fund's own expense ratio just in platform fees.\n\nMy concern with POEMS is that I don't keep a large cash buffer by choice. I'd rather have my cash deployed instead of sitting as collateral for a CPFIS order, because that’s cash I can't use to buy opportunistically in IBKR. Other than that, the collateral window is only a few days but having a longer settlement period during market downturns actually matters to me. There’s also the matter of the minimum investment size which causes odd lots in POEMS, but that’s another topic.\n\nAm I missing anything that carry Amundi funds for CPFIS? And for those of you on Endowus for CPFIS, do you just accept the 0.30% as the price of convenience, or have you found a way around it?\n\n**EDIT**: Thanks everyone for the updates!

I've always been a good saver and have a pretty healthy relationship with money overall.\n\nIn 2024, I signed an endowment plan at $300/mth and an ILP at $700/mth (huge mistake, i know😭). I plan to surrender my endowment with $0 surrender value as it's honestly not that huge a sum and i value opportunity cost more going forward. I also plan to reduce my ILP premium to just $300/mth, current valuation sitting at ~$16k. \n\nWith that, i should be able to aggressively invest about $1.2k comfortably every month. I have a time horizon of 20-25 years and can stomach drawdowns from -40% to -50%. \n\nAfter doing my research, i've built my own portfolio and it looks like this:\n\n40% VTI\n30% QQQM\n15% VHT\n15% VXUS\n\nLogic is that the trend seems to be moving towards heavily on tech and healthcare. And i want maximum growth since i can stomach the big drawdowns. I also plan to divert my ILP to a more moderate risk portfolio to cushion my risk.

Over a long period of time, I am surprised that CPF balance can be quite substantial. It doesn't feel much on a month by month basis but if you work for a long time, it can be significant.\n2. FRS will continue to grow and hence this is something to take note of. \n3. For BHS cap, if we were to assume that is the amount to target to ensure proper health coverage, it seems quite a challenge to hit it as well i.e. meaning one might have to have cash or insurance to address any unforeseen medical issue.\n4. Reaching FRS is doable but ERS is a different thing. You are likely not going to hit it unless you do active topping up. What are your thoughts? Would you try to go for ERS for the higher monthly payout.\n5. Delay CPF Life payout might increase the payout by a few hundreds but I am not sure if it worth the delay. Would you start your CPF life at 65 or later.\n6. My expense maybe on the high side because I realized CPF Life only contribute to less than 50% of expense. I am not sure if there is so called a \"target\" since everyone life style is different. How much does CPF life payout covers your expenses? I have peers that can cover up to 80% of their expenses.\n\n  \nHope you find this useful and would like to hear your thoughts as well!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lrleibmy9gkg1.png?width=1219&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc3152229a79b7829fa27d042010d8c39b04dede\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xcgnh0v1agkg1.png?width=1226&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d7e2742dfbd748c18aa9d6789172280d3875365\n\n",

          "text": "This is my take on CPF LIFE. \n\nThe scheme is primarily a longevity insurance, with the key point on it being an insurance at the end of the day. People who focus on ‘breakeven’ ages and how to profit the most from it are missing the point - you don’t buy hospitalisation insurance and calculate how many times you have to get warded for it to be worth it, you don’t buy term insurance and say it’s worth if you die before X years old, so you shouldn’t be saying CPF LIFE is worth if you live to Y years old. You ‘buy’ into it for the insurance aspect and not to profit from it (because statistically you will not).\n\nNow while it’s not like term or CI insurance where you can explicitly choose a dollar amount to buy, the choices you have in the scheme determines the coverage of this ‘longevity insurance’. \nNamely, in increasing order of coverage \n1) BRS (pledging property)-&gt; FRS -&gt; ERS\n2) Basic -&gt; standard -&gt; escalating withdrawal plan\n3) how delayed the payouts start after age 65\n\nFor most, BRS to ERS is obvious but why is escalating and delayed considered a higher coverage? Because you’re paying a higher cost now to get a larger future payout (protection), the same way you would pay more for a term insurance with a higher sum assured.\n\nSo if you want the least coverage in this insurance, you go for BRS + basic + immediate start whereas the ‘highest’ coverage (meaning the most protection against living long) would be ERS + escalating + delay to 70.\n\nSo naturally the question is how much coverage do you need? Higher coverage is not always good since you’re paying more for it as well. For term or CI insurance, there are guidelines like 5x income but from what I know CPF doesn’t give much guidance on _how_ to choose between the options, they just present the facts to you and let you decide. \n\nTo me, the higher your net worth the less you need longevity insurance, since the chance you outlive your money pot is smaller. So if you’ve not much saved for retirement, max out CPF and go for the ‘highest’ coverage. Whereas if you have 10M then you really don’t need any longevity insurance and you should go for the minimum.",

At 4% interest rate, your money is doubled after waiting about 18yrs.\n\nThe power of forced savings is amazing too. CPF Board forces us to save 20% of our income, and then my mother forced me to save another 20% of my take-home pay in a 20yr savings endowment plan. Both of these pay relatively low interest rates 2 - 4% but because capital is guaranteed so no complaints. The best benefit here is forced to save up no need to apply self-discipline.\n\nThe above 2 methods of growing wealth are suitable only for people who doesn't take any risks and who doesn't wish to seek greater yields in other investment vehicles.\n\nI am below 55 so currently I only top-up the amount that CPF Board allows me to (8k or less each year) for the purpose of tax relief. I also top-up $15,300 into SRS also for the purpose of tax relief.\n\nOnly after I have fully paid up my flat then I grew a pair of balls (joking lah, I am still an auntie, did not turn into an uncle) and I started learning about stocks, unit trusts and index funds. The balls I grew are not that big, so I did not venture into Cryptocurrency or Options (but hor I have more gutsy real uncle friends who are into these 2 lehhh).\n\nEhh wait, sorry I sidetracked too much already. Back to the question of ERS. Do I think after my 55th birthday I will want to actively top-up CPF RA to hit ERS? In the past, when I only knew 2 methods of growing wealth that time, I will say yes. Now I will say no. Cash is still king, you can decide what you want to invest in freely without restrictions. If you loved Apple you can go buy Apples, if you love Alphabet you can go and buy Alphabets, and, if you can't decide which of the top companies got the most growth potential you can just buy S&amp;P500 index funds.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, CPF Life payout ($1000+) should only form a small portion of retirement income because CPF Life payout is enough to live on but not enough to have a life. Confusing? What I mean is you will have enough sustenance and surely won't die of hunger but you won't have a vibrant existence (imagine no overseas holidays and no regular fancy restaurant meals).\n\nAbout CPF Life payout adequacy and your high expenses, I will reassure you by telling you that you don't need to lose sleep over it because humans are highly adaptable intelligent beings. There is the opposite of \"lifestyle creep/inflation\"; call it \"lifestyle uncreep/deflation\" if you will. I give you 2 real life examples:\n\n1) My father is a gambler (Singapore Pools is his best friend) and saved up $0 of his $5k monthly income. At retirement, all he got is CPF savings because thank you CPF Board stopped him from gambling away CPF RA. He is now retired and living on CPF Life $900/mth. My sister and I help him by paying for his maid's salary and expenses, we don't give him cash because Singapore Pools is still his best friend.\n\n2) My ex-colleague used to live a high life travelling the world, buying luxury goods and eating at fancy restaurant regularly and she also saved up $0 of her I-dunno-how much monthly income. At retirement, she was so worried that she can't survive without work but she had worried for nothing. Now she has adapted to her new lifestyle so well until she recently told me her $1,300/mth CPF Life too much so she will still have balance leftover every month.",

So long as you're always at or above the median income for graduates of your cohort, you will certainly reach FRS in SA - by 40 if you max out BHS by 28. Much earlier if you also topup your SA / do OA transfers (neither are recommended in my opinion due to ringfencing). I personally do not recommend ERS for those with liquid assets of between 1-3M in retirement. It is fine for those with less (meaning they were never able to amass sufficient assets hence hints at lack of ability) or more (ERS is insignificant).\n\nI would not base my retirement income solely on CPF Life: too much concentration risk. My retirement income pillars would likely be: CPF OA (15-20%), CPF Life Basic - BRS (5-10%), rent (20-30%), SRS (10-15%) and cash investments (remainder) and at any time, always 50-100k in cash or equivalent for emergencies. \n\nIt is also important to account for inflation which is why most of my retirement income sources would have some form of inflation peg. CPF Life, even the escalating plan, would see real retirement incomes shrink over 20-30 years (when payouts start at 65 till the likely life expectancy age of 90+ for my cohort).

If you have no income, the Banks will require you to at least pledge 4years of your monthly installment + show proof of eligible financial assets(this amount may vary from bank to bank, and can be as much as 3-4 times of the loan you wish to get). \n\nIf you have an existing mortgage, and it is your only mortgage loan, AND you are residing there, you have more options. You can choose to refinance the loan to another Bank or reprice the loan with the existing Bank. I am assuming this is a private property rather than a HDB given you mentioned is bank.some banks may offer you a lower interest rate package that you can switch to after your lock in period is over. Some banks allow you to switch earlier within the same Bank with repricing. For owner occupied properties, the process is very much more simplified. \n\nHowever, if this is not your only property loan, or it is a home equity loan that you are leveraging on a property you are renting out/investment property, then you face more obstacles to refinance/reprice without income that is recognisable. Most banks require you to go through TDSR (total debt servicing ratio) assessment if so, but if you are willing to pay down 3% of the loan under a Debt reduction plan, you get to skip the TDSR. This applies even if you are repricing within the same Bank and is a regulatory requirement. My concern for you would be if you took this loan back when TDSR was allowed to be higher eg like your mortgage consists of 60% of your gross monthly income then, you might find it difficult to pass the TDSR now if you really want to switch to a lower interest rate package, especially if you don’t have the same amount of recognisable income. You also have the option to keep a portion of money with the Bank (about 4 years of your monthly installment as collateral that you can’t touch) to pass TDSR, but it’s not a sound course, given you can use the funds for other purposes.  Most people also don’t know this, but if the property loan is a housing loan, not an equity term loan, you can try to apply to CPF to use a portion of your OA to pay down the housing loan, even if the property is an investment unit, especially if you have already activated CPF usage for it back when you first bought the property. It would make sense in the event mortgage rates go back above CPF OA rate. \n\nMortgage rate packages also differ from bank to bank and every month or even week could be different, depending on the Bank’s cost of funds. Before you make any decision, you should do your own due diligence. What works for others may not work for your risk appetite. Don’t let what your aunty uncle tell you in CNY affect what kind of mortgage package you take up especially if it affects at least next few years of your life.",

Technically it was supposed to be a condition that shouldn’t have been covered, hence the insurer rejected the claim  (congenital illness has a 1 year waiting period, 9month old baby has no symptoms at birth + it was a congenital condition that will take a while to surface, and the symptoms only surfaced when she was 9 months old) - but the insurance company ended up covering the costs of the hospitalisation after I went to fidrec. Disclaimer: This is not the full account of the situation, I don’t want to type too much on Reddit so I’m just keeping it concise. \n\nAnyway, just go and contact fidrec if you have to!

What you can invest in depends on your brokerage account.\n\n  \nSo what you need now is to find a brokerage that can support SRS investing. The most common ones are POEMS and Stashaway. For Singapore, you generally can't find a good way to invest SRS funds into single stocks like GOOG but LSE ETFs are more easily accessible. Typical investments for SRS funds include the Amundi World Unit Trust (similar to SWRD) via POEMs and Amundi US Trust (similar to CSPX I believe) via POEMs. Note that these are Unit Trusts, not ETFs.\n\n\n\nStashway recently introduced a new product called ETF Explorer where you can buy ETFs directly via their platform at a 1 USD fee.

How should I choose them and how was the recommended option chosen?

E.g. any specific illnesses\n- would be good to have some explanation on the coverage amounts chosen, or some back of the envelope working. Otherwise it's quite easy for the agent to persuade someone to buy higher coverage \"just in case\"\n- minor point that the tool tips are finicky on mobile (sometimes disappears immediately after clicked)\n\n\nI understand these can be answered by doing some research, but I think it'll be helpful to piece them all together in your website. ",
