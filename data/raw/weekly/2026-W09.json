      "selftext": "In December, a former student of an elite Singapore primary school posted a video recalling how her classmates were genuinely shocked to discover - from a textbook - that most Singaporeans live in HDB flats. They weren't being cruel. They simply didn't know. She could name only one classmate who lived in public housing.\n\nTwo months later, the Ministry of Finance published its first-ever measure of wealth inequality. The wealth Gini coefficient stands at 0.55 - significantly higher than the income Gini of 0.38. The top one per cent of households holds fourteen per cent of total wealth. The top five per cent holds a third. And the ministry's own paper concedes these figures are \"likely to be underestimated,\" because tracking the assets of the wealthy in a global financial hub built on confidentiality is, to put it gently, structurally difficult.\n\nThe elite school children and the wealth data describe the same country. A place where parallel tracks run so cleanly that the people designing the system and the people living under it can occupy the same island without ever seeing each other's Singapore.\n\n\n\nThe conventional explanation for Singapore's welfare architecture is pragmatism. A small, resource-scarce nation chose self-reliance over dependency. CPF forces citizens to save for their own retirement. HDB subsidies help them own homes. Workfare supplements low wages. MediShield Life covers catastrophic healthcare costs. The system works, or at least, it has worked, and the philosophy behind it is coherent: help people help themselves.\n\nBut here is what the philosophy actually produces. CPF is not a pension. It is a forced-savings vehicle that transfers retirement risk entirely to the individual, which only works if every individual earns enough to save enough. Those who don't aren't covered by the philosophy. They are contradicted by it. HDB is not social housing. It is a property market with subsidised entry, designed to appreciate, which means housing wealth accrues to those who bought early and cheaply, and becomes less accessible to each successive generation. Workfare is not welfare. It is a wage supplement conditional on employment, which vanishes the moment you lose your job.\n\nSingapore already redistributes. It subsidises, supplements, and co-pays. It simply refuses to call any of it welfare, because the ideology of self-reliance demands that every transfer look like an earned benefit rather than a social entitlement. At what point does \"self-reliance\" become a branding exercise for a welfare state that won't name itself?\n\nThe resistance to calling it what it is runs deeper than fiscal conservatism. It is ideological. And the ideology is most visible not in what the state does - it already redistributes - but in the language it uses to disguise the fact. Every mechanism is named so that it sounds like your effort rather than their provision. The grammar of self-reliance must never be broken.\n\nConsider the architecture of political compensation. Ministerial salaries are benchmarked to the median income of the top one thousand Singapore citizen earners - the very group whose wealth the MOF paper says is probably underreported - with a forty per cent discount framed as sacrifice. The entry-level minister's norm salary is 1.1 million dollars. The review committee convened in January to reassess this framework will update the benchmark. Nobody has proposed updating the data.\n\nOr consider Ridout Road, where two cabinet ministers rented state-owned colonial bungalows - one at twenty-six thousand five hundred dollars a month, the other spending over two hundred thousand on renovations - and were cleared of wrongdoing by an investigation led by a cabinet colleague. The Prime Minister said he \"cannot outsource\" the determination of what is proper. He was right, technically. The system investigated itself and found nothing wrong. That is precisely the problem.\n\nThis is not corruption in the classical sense. It is something more durable: a governing class so insulated from median life that the distance has become invisible, to them.\n\n\n\nDenmark made a different choice. Not a more generous choice, a structurally different one.\n\nThe Danish model of flexicurity combines some of the easiest hiring-and-firing rules in Europe with generous unemployment benefits and aggressive state-funded retraining. You can be let go on short notice. But when you are, the state catches you with up to ninety per cent of your previous salary for up to two years, on the condition that you actively retrain for new work. The result is a labour market that is simultaneously more fluid than Singapore's and more secure.\n\nThis is counterintuitive, and that is the point. Denmark's system does not punish risk. It absorbs it collectively, which means workers accept industrial change instead of fearing it, and employers restructure without the social cost that Singapore outsources to individuals. Denmark spends roughly twenty-eight per cent of GDP on social protection. Singapore spends approximately nine. That nineteen-point gap is not a spending difference. It is a trust difference. The Nordic model trusts citizens and taxes them heavily. Singapore's model distrusts citizens and taxes them lightly, then charges them heavily for services. Whether the state exists to protect citizens from market failure, or to ensure they face it alone, is not a fiscal question. It is a political one.\n\n\n\nBut distrust, sustained long enough, becomes self-fulfilling. Design a system where every citizen's retirement depends on individual savings, where housing is an appreciating asset rather than a social good, where support vanishes the moment employment does, and within a generation you will have produced citizens who behave exactly as the system assumed they would. The ideology didn't just shape policy. It shaped the people. And now the people sustain the ideology voluntarily, which is the most effective form of political control there is: one that no longer requires enforcement.\n\nSo here is the part that neither the government nor the opposition will say plainly.\n\nThe obstacle to a Nordic-style social contract in Singapore is not the People's Action Party. It is the Singaporeans the system produced.\n\nThree days after the MOF paper documented rising wealth inequality and declining social mobility, Budget 2026 arrived. The fiscal surplus for the previous year was fifteen point one billion dollars, more than double the initial estimate. The government's response: two hundred to four hundred dollars in cash handouts, CDC vouchers, and U-Save rebates. Even a PAP backbencher, Shawn Loh, stood up in Parliament to propose returning surpluses above two per cent of GDP directly to citizens and called for progressive stamp duties on inherited property. Workers' Party MP Louis Chua went further, calling wealth inequality Singapore's \"deepest division\" and urging the reinstatement of estate duty, abolished in 2008. The government's reply, via Acting Transport Minister Jeffrey Siow: \"We have no plans at this point to seek additional legislative or administrative powers to require more granular asset disclosure solely for inequality measurement.\"\n\nThey will not even sharpen the tools to measure the problem, let alone fix it. Even the reforms now being floated - higher property taxes, progressive stamp duties - trim the top without lifting the floor. They generate revenue, not entitlements. And in a country that actively recruits ultra-high-net-worth residents as policy, the top replenishes itself faster than any tax can trim it. Singapore does not have a wealth inequality problem despite its economic strategy. It has one because of it.\n\nAnd yet. Before we reach for outrage at the government, a more uncomfortable question: would Singaporeans actually vote for what a Nordic model requires?\n\nNot higher taxes. That is the easy, tired version of the question. The real one cuts closer.\n\nThe Nordic social contract requires treating housing as shelter, not as an investment vehicle. Over half of average household wealth across every income quintile in Singapore is held in home equity. When you check your HDB resale value - and you do - you are not merely a homeowner. You are a stakeholder in a system that requires property prices to keep rising, which is structurally incompatible with treating housing as a universal social good. A Danish-style housing model would stabilise your home's value. In Singapore, that is not policy. That is a threat.\n\nIt requires treating education as levelling, not sorting. Finland has no elite schools. Every school is designed to produce roughly equivalent outcomes. Would Singaporean parents accept that? The influencer Nicole Chen, responding to the viral video, said she would still enrol her children in her elite alma mater - for the opportunities, the co-curriculars, the overseas trips. She is not wrong to want these things for her children. She is describing exactly why the system cannot change.\n\nIt requires a culture that discourages status comparison. The Danes have a name for it - Janteloven - the social norm that no one should consider themselves above others. Singapore's entire social engine runs on the opposite principle: visible markers of success, relentless ranking, the quiet tracking of who upgraded from BTO to resale to condo. The Nordic model doesn't just redistribute money. It requires a society that stops keeping score the way we do.\n\n\n\nThe MOF paper diagnosed the disease. Budget 2026 prescribed paracetamol. But the deeper question is not what the government is willing to do. It is what we are willing to give up - and whether we can still tell the difference between what we genuinely value and what the system trained us to want.\n\nThe question is not whether Singapore will adopt the Nordic model. It won't. The question is whether Singaporeans would vote for a society where nobody keeps score, and whether we would even recognise ourselves in it.",

Early retirement is taboo. There is a cultural expectation that you work as long as you are able, because then your taxes fund the social system that you benefit from. Even being a stay-at-home-mom is culturally looked down upon. The maternity benefits are generous, but once you use them up, it's back to work for you. As you rightly point out, all those work together as a system. Their system makes it easy to work; the expectation is that you keep working. If a bunch of rich people move to Denmark with existing wealth and leech off their welfare systems, it would probably break the country.\n\n\nWould Singaporean go for such a system? Great question! I can't even imagine how we could even transition into such a system. So many policies support each other in making the system work. It's a kind of local-optimisation problem. I also can't imagine the average Singaporean, having worked themselves to death in the current system to accumulate wealth and safeguard our own retirement, to then turn around and move into a system where we can't use that wealth to retire early.",

Maybe the first step is to see how we can promote greater dignity and respect for all, regardless of station in life.

If it is not packed, [LTA will try to make it so](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/intervals-between-trains-during-off-peak-hours-could-be-extended-khaw-boon-wan). \n\nOur government in the 1990s had the wealth to pay for that (then) modern marvel, at a time where our GDP per capita was behind the likes of Italy.\n\nToday, we have very high GDP, but no money to pay for the same marvel the previous generation enjoyed.\n\nBack in the 1990s, the government could afford to build lines well in advance, to new towns that were literally *new*. They do not need to pack the trains, it is an infrastructure that is not just speedy, but very comfortable (non air con buses were a thing).\n\nToday, even the dumpster fire that is NEL and NSL could not make them expedite building the Seletar Line. No matter how many people have been lobbying them over the years, they just would not extend JRL to CCL before “2040s”, the same crappy timeline as the long delayed Seletar line.\n\nMRT is just one, but not the only thing, that had regressed as our country got wealthier.\n\nAs we get wealthier, the more quality of life stuff gets cut. MRT becomes more crowded while fares go up. Housing becomes smaller while prices go up. Rental prices so high the only things we get to enjoy are the same old franchises and chains.\n\nFor the older generations, they were so loyal to the government because the wealthier the nation, the better things were.\n\nFor us, the wealthier the nation, the worse things seem to get.

It's ironic that almost everyone will agree that education should not be 'one size fits all', but customised to the needs of different learner profiles, yet think that the GEP is suitable for every average kid and is a miracle pill to success as long as they are shoved through the door. There's nothing wrong with being an average kid, but there are much more suitable academic paths for these kids that give them a far better shot at success (whatever success may be).",

But book-smart individuals being eventually found in jobs that select for academic performance should be no surprise.\n\nMy biggest takeaway was that we got to explore things that were outside of the standard curriculum (fairy tales and mystery stories during English lessons come to mind), and teachers were generally given free rein to structure their lessons. For the most part, it kept us engaged and interested to explore more, and I think that would have been a great outcome in and of itself\n\nEdit: Something I did hear a fair bit back that was that being in GEP supposedly meant that we were the top 1% of the cohort. It made me feel good, but I would go on to meet other people from this same group who were truly out-of-this-world intelligent and talented, and made me feel like a talking baboon next to them. Suffice to say, it was a humbling experience.\n\nThinking back about it now, I realize that perhaps I was only in the 1% of the people who could actually take a random \"extra\" test seriously at 9 yo haha, plenty of true geniuses out there who were occupied with other pursuits then, I'm sure",

The dept where I worked had 3 desk top computers set up on separate work desks for 12 officers to share. Most of the officers use the typist pool to prepare simple letters or faxes, because they were used to the typist pool and not familiar with word processing on computers. No email back then. So the 3 computers sat in the lonely corner and were seldom used  This was in spite of having to wait at least 1 hour for a simple letter or fax to be typed by the typist pool.\nWithin another 3 years, all officers had their own desk top computers and the typist pool disappeared, and email started to appear. Officers no longer had to waste time waiting for a letter or fax to be typed. Productivity increased through the roof.\nMy point is AI is a more powerful, more comprehensive tool than the humble desktop computer. It not only increases productivity, it can value-add and create.  \nI believe AI is not a bubble and is only going to become more important, just like computers back in the 80's. However, the workforce needs time to learn and get used to this new work process. And like the typists in the typist pool, the govt needs to figure out how the workforce remains employed with the advent of AI.",

Today’s microwave can cook a frozen burrito. Tomorrow’s microwave will be able to cook an entire Thanksgiving Dinner. Ten years from now a microwave may even be able to run the country.\n\n\nRecently I was watching a livestream of a local microwave salesman. He suggested that restaurants should cook all their food in a microwave.\n\n\nWe all need to transition to this way of cooking, because clearly this is where the future is going. I expect in a few short years kitchens will be much smaller. Gone will be stoves and ovens and flat tops. Restaurant kitchens will only be a small closet with a microwave. I predict this will happen by 1955 at the latest.\n\n\nMany chefs I know get upset at me when I tell them this. But this is the truth: If you can’t cook everything you make in a microwave thats a skill issue. You need to learn now because when everything is cooked in a microwave you’ll be out of a job. When microwaves are everywhere you’ll be so far behind you’ll never learn how to use a microwave. Chefs who use tools besides microwaves are luddites. They live in fear of the future.\n\n\nIf you want to learn how to use a microwave I would suggest starting with my $49.99 two week course. You should also subscribe to my blog.\n\n\nRecently I was banned from my favorite chef subreddit for posting pictures of all my microwaved food. I was told I was spamming. These are the types of emotional people I deal with. But much like any other discriminated against group I am fighting for acceptance. If my microwaved food triggers you then you clearly are not ready to accept the future of all food.\n\n\nAt my restaurant I’ve moved all my employees to exclusively using microwaves. After I threatened to fire any employee that complained everyone told me the microwaves were great. But I only threatened them so everyone would love the microwaves.\n\n\nOne of my chefs mentioned that if they could cook the steak on the grill they could get it right the first time. This is not an acceptable attitude in the microwave era. Chefs have fragile egos and they all seem to enjoy cooking (???) so it’s obvious they’re just too attached to the food. Also they’re worried I’m planning on firing all of them. That’s true but not relevant here.\n\n\nI’ve solved this by putting blindfolds on all my chefs. In no circumstances are they to look at the food. I don’t look at the food either. Looking at the food is how restaurants in the past operated. We don’t work that way any more. Have there been several poisonings? Yes. But the food gets out much faster now.\n\n\n\n——- \n\n\nAnd yes people were saying microwave will replace chef decades ago. Neither chef nor microwave cease to exist. There’s still place for both just different role",

          "text": "Firstly, you need to have a good idea of all the places they are coming from. Spend a few nights working late and wander around your home late at night at random intervals. When you spot a cockroach, besides killing it, notice where it's coming from. Also check all your cabinets late at night to see if cockroaches show up in them. They are typically attracted to places closer to food sources so it's usually your kitchen cabinets. If you do find them in cabinets, don't kill them or empty your cabinets yet.\n\nSecondly, order Advion roach gel from online. I don't know the size of your home but the 4-tube pack (around 50-60 SGD) will be more than enough. I recommend avoiding any gel/bait you can find in local supermarkets because believe it or not, they're all useless. (Sprays are only good for manual kills and even then they leave behind residue which is a hazard for babies and pets which you have to clean up after.)\n\nThirdly, having identified all the areas they are spawning, now then is the time to empty any infested cabinets and do a one-time mass cleaning / manual cockroach killing with spray and/or good old slippers. Having done that, you can then squirt tiny, droplet-sized squirts of roach gel in the all places you think roaches are most likely to reappear, especially the pathways you think they frequent (Take care not to use gel in places babies/dogs/cats can reach). **I guarantee if you do this carefully and diligently, you will turn the tide with just 1-2 tubes of Advion with waves of dead roaches in 2 weeks and completely obliterate them within 3 months**. There, I gave you the solution, all that's left to do is execute. (I also heard good things about diatomaceous earth but I cannot vouch for that one because I've never tried it).\n\nOne thing to note: some old flats don't just have a built-in chute problem. They have a vent below the gas stove that allows any leaked ~~methane~~ LPG gas to sink to the floor and pass through. That is an even more direct highway for roaches into your kitchen. If you have that, I recommend gating it with a bit of stainless steel wire screen mesh sealed in place with silicone sealant. Do some research to learn the equipment you will need for this.",

I kept telling myself I should be grateful, which I was, but that didn’t stop the dread on Sunday nights.\n\nI recently decided to change things up in a pretty big way.

Gender ratios always skewed. Always more guys than gals (estimate 80-20 ratio), which made it uncomfortable for everyone as there'd be minimum 4 guys swarming around 1 gal. What made it even worse was the more attractive ones would often be swamped which made them feel overwhelmed and those who weren't getting any attention were rightfully miffed\n\n2. No facilitation by host/organiser. Using the swarming example, a good host/organiser would step in and redistribute the pax but nothing was done. No facilitation either or if any facilitation done, not much thought was put into how to actually get participants to interact in a meaningful manner\n\n3. Poor venue setup. Most of the events comprised sitdown tables and chairs, which are only helpful for e.g. speed dating or if the organiser/host is facilitating by moving people around. So you would have people hogging the chairs and tables and refusing to move while others stood around hovering behind others - very uncomfortable\n\n4. Most crucially, host/organiser seemed to just want to earn money from the event while preying on the optimism or hope of participants but not doing anything productive. Why I say so is that the event format was still the same each time, despite feedback given to the organiser, which meant the issues mentioned above were recurring. Yet because the participants were hopeful to meet someone, they just kept coming for the events, which means the previous events weren't effective at connecting people romantically and which also means the organiser/host has a captive audience to exploit and profit from",

At the very least, I’d get to see how these things work.\n\nIMO, it was badly organised and a complete waste of money.\n\nIt was at a two-storey shophouse turned into a clubhouse, KTV on the first floor, pool table upstairs. Turnout was over 100 people, and from what I saw, there were more women than men.\n\nThe format was simple. You fill in a survey, answer a like or dislike personality question, take a Polaroid, and they print a kind of resume profile. Everything gets pasted on a wall for everyone to browse.\n\nThe only complimentary drinks were Oatside milk and bottled green tea. Wine was $6 or $8 a glass. That was it.\n\nThe founder attempted an icebreaker. We were split into groups and made to answer trivia questions like “What’s the capital of Brazil?” Then the organiser announced which team won and… that was the end of it. No follow-up, no actual interaction. Ice thoroughly unbroken. Like HUH? What ICE? \n\nSo I did what I usually do in social situations. I went around and spoke to anyone and everyone. I wasn’t there with a specific agenda or type in mind. The resumes were actually useful conversation starters, but you cannot just rely on 1 sentence to continue a conversation. I remembered one of the girls had a ‘I made this outfit I’m currently wearing from a workshop!’ \n\nBut it felt like most people were there with a clear end goal. Fair enough, it’s a dating event. Still, many conversations ended abruptly, or people drifted off mid-chat to find someone else.\n\nI spoke to a police officer, two tech bros, an early childhood educator, two guys of questionable background, and a medical researcher who also does part-time modelling. Ironically, he was the only person I ended up exchanging contacts with. Everyone else didn’t seem keen to continue the conversation.\n\nThe saddest part was observing a few guys who clearly weren’t socially comfortable. Some looked fresh out of NS. They stood around alone, drink in hand, scanning the room and waiting for someone to approach them. It was hard to watch.\n\nAt one point I suggested to the organiser that maybe she could host more actively. She said the idea was to let people mingle organically. Personally, if I’m charging $48 a head, I’d structure the experience a lot more intentionally. If I’m paying that amount to do essentially nothing, I can think of better ways to spend it. It reeks of poor organising IMO, if I had wanted to just do an event like this it’s really not that hard. \n\nWhat surprised me, though, was overhearing a woman sincerely thanking the organiser and saying she really enjoyed the event. So clearly, it works for some people.\n\nThe medical researcher-model guy, who was probably the most conventionally attractive person there, ended up leaving alone too. I found that oddly amusing.\n\nMy friend, who dragged me there, eventually said it was too overwhelming for him as an introvert and disappeared. I was like, bro, you invited me.\n\nI left feeling bored overall. But if you’re into social anthropology, it would have been a fascinating case study. Watching who approaches, who waits, who performs confidence, who actually connects, and who doesn’t. That part was interesting? \n\nWould I go again? Probably not.

      "selftext": "My (24F) brother (20M) has always been a normal kid until he went to secondary school. It definitely changed him, and he started becoming rude to me and our parents. Told him off for his behaviour and it mellowed a lot so it was fine from then until Y2 of poly.\n\nHe often comes back at 3-4am doing God knows what and he became aggressive towards my mother, me, and my youngest brother (12M). Note that he's never showed this side to my father because he fears him. \n\nWhat happened yesterday was the last straw for me. He was already in a bad mood when he came home in the evening yesterday. My youngest brother accidentally took his phone thinking it was his and my brother literally hit him on his back twice. He hit so hard that a handprint is left on my youngest brother's back. My brother then tearfully said it was because he mistook my brother's phone as his. Naturally, my mom was pissed and scolded him but he argued back saying it's because he took his phone. I also chided him for being rude and he called me a chibai and to stfu. At one point I put my hand on his shoulder and he shoved me and shouted to not touch him. He then came up to me gangster-like, pointed in my face and said \"I'm warning you ah, don't fucking touch me\". So my mother scolded him again.\n\nAn argument between him and my mother ensued. He kept playing the victim and said that \"everyone mistreats him\" and it's crazy because everything has always been handed to you.. You want a new bed, parents buy for you. You want a Nike duffel bag, parents buy for you. You want new clothes, parents buy for you. You want a Carhartt bag, parents buy for you. You want to learn driving, parents pay for you. Even I had to work for things that I want. I digress, my mother then declared that since he claims everyone mistreats him, she will not pay for anything for him anymore and will not support him. \n\nLater that night as I was doing my work, he came to me, pointed a finger in my face and said the same warning about touching him. It's funny because I know very well that he doesn't dare to act like this outside. He always keeps his head down when he sees people his age. \n\nMy brother has always been a normal kid but I have no idea what type of people he's mixing with to turn out like this. He outrights challenges my mother and threatened to \"whack me\" in front of her. Apologies for the long post, has anyone had similar experiences and/or tips on what to do with him?",

Your bro also has unresolved trauma and maybe he's also going through a phase where he's finally coming to terms with all the abuse he went through that's why he's being more extreme as a push back (I know I went through the same when I was in my early 20s lol)\n\nIf you really wanna get involved you have to approach it as someone on his side, don't immediately take the side of who's \"right\" because his mindset and view is clearly very narrowed right now. Try and understand where he's coming from, ask him why he feels the way he does, ask him if there's anything you can do to make the situation better (within reasonable means). This is to help process emotions and understand them too\n\nI grew up with emotionally abusive and poor parenting too with my sis being the problem child (hello autism) but we remain close to this day cause I listened to my sis and we communicate our thoughts and feelings to each other. We also have each others' back when our mum is being abusive so it helped strengthen the bond and understanding, and I use that to convey reasoning across to my sis when I think they're doing wrong\n\nBtw material wealth is not a stand in fix for childhood trauma lol, ask me how I know\n\nIf he actually gets violent you have to call the police to deescalate the situation",

When he is, try to de-escalate, by being the calmer one, and not matching or escalating the volume of your voice or any harsh words. There is no point in trying to tell him what is wrong with his actions when he is not a state to receive this. Give him time and space to calm down. You can tell him that you want to give him time and space to calm down but you would like to talk to him when he is in a better head space.\n\nWhen he is calmer, then talk to him. Instead of accusing him and finger pointing and telling him what you think of his behaviour, try to ask why questions first. Why is he acting this way? Why does he feel like he is the victim? Even if you disagree with his reasons, just let him talk first and vent his POV. Ask more questions than giving statements. The point is, you want to try to understand why he thinks the way he does, and why it is so different from the viewpoint that you have.\n\nIf he is receptive, then give your POV and the reasons why you think his behaviour is unacceptable. Try to do this in a calm, non-accusatory way but to explain what you perceive as unacceptable consequences of his behaviour. Example, when you say ABC, you make the family feel XYZ.\n\nIf you feel the conversation starting to become heated, or he is starting to shut down or close off, end it for now and let him know you both can continue the conversation when you’re both in a better headspace. It may not be easy and make several tries.\n\nThe key point here is to be able to get him to talk openly and honestly and calmly, and to bridge the communication and POV gap. Shutting down communication doesn’t help anyone. It may lead to him feeling even more misunderstood and you never learn why and you can’t help him if you don’t understand him.\n\nGood luck, OP.",

It’s really up to u to think whether the job stress or not - at least to some extent. Idk if I can go back to my previous job with the same mindset because like I’ve said, certain jobs are like this, the nature of it makes it stays in your mind more, blur the boundaries more, but when I first started in my new job, I also felt stressed (lol) so I realised it’s a me problem and I work on that so I don’t keep thinking about work and stressing myself out. I just purposely don’t think and purposely output 85% and I realise eh still ok leh. Everything is still fine. I didn’t need to like pull my hair out for the day to finish nicely soooooooo jiayou jiayou!!",

But then again i would say this period made me grow a-lot as a person.",

The 1st 6 months was by choice, worked in frontline healthcare for almost a decade and had been getting increasingly burnt out for the last few years. Traveled for a few months, did some soul searching, long story short I realised I really needed a career change, as I felt that my experience in the healthcare system was deviating further and further from why I decided to work in healthcare in the 1st place, and the physical load also had a lot of negative effects on my own body over time which I ended up having to pay to seek treatments for myself. \n\nStarted exploring options and doing some upskilling after that thinking I wanted to go into a certain industry, but then Trump came into power, things happened in global markets, spoke to someone in that industry who was still very optimistic about hiring so I continued looking for a job there to no avail. Few months later found out from a new contact that industry had a huge retrenchment, so had to re-explore options again.\n\nEventually found out more about HR and felt that it aligned with my values and goals, so took up a WSQ HR diploma. Been trying to find a HR job until now but has been hard finding an entry level position... Maybe companies just prefer younger new grads who can presumably take a lower starting pay. But anyway I ended up taking an admin job with a really huge pay cut just for the experience while still continuing my search... Didn't go back to work in my previous job as the thought of it just filled me with dread and was really detrimental mental health-wise. \n\nSo the fact is there is a lot of opportunity cost for me to be doing this, but it's kind of like buying sanity I guess. Also would probably have worked out better if I decided to do a career switch maybe a year earlier when the job market was still good. But well, we can't tell the future 🤷🏻‍♀️  and so the journey continues, and I'll just deal with the challenges as they come.\n\nBut anyway, overall I still have no regrets as the break did give me good bandwidth to do a lot of reflection and soul searching that I had not been able to do while I was constantly tired out from working. If you have enough funds to cover, I'd say go for it. Life is more than just money and career.",

Which place has more expertise with this specific condition?\n- I see lots of people saying the US will have better care. On average, the US tends to rank lower than Singapore in outcomes, but it is highly variable across the country so it depends on which hospital you are sending your kid to. Singapore General Hospital also has been ranking in the top 10 hospitals in the world for a while now (but it doesn’t have pediatrics). Singapore is smaller but does act as a regional centre for rarer diseases (in wealthier patients, as it has better healthcare than surrounding countries. Ultimately, it really depends on the condition, and I would suggest contacting the 2 public hospitals with pediatrics departments (National University Hospital, KK Hospital) to find out who your son would be seeing and what equipment/treatment they have that your son would require\n2. How are you financing his care?\n- Healthcare in Singapore is generally more affordable than in the US, especially for Singapore citizens so applyjng for citizenship is definitely a good idea. This kind of mitochondrial genetic disease will be lifelong so it’s worth considering if he will be covered by insurance in the long term. There could be lots of unexpected costs even if you think paying for treatment is financially viable in the short term. If he did not already have private health insurance before this, it will be hard to get it now. So the mandatory insurance system in Singapore could be quite helpful in this case\n\nThe other issues you raised probably won’t be an issue. His access to healthcare will be fine, especially as a patient with a more serious condition. School in Singapore is more stressful &amp; rigorous than that in the US. If he ends up with some level of intellectual disability, I would recommend staying in the US instead as our special needs programs are not quite as developed. NS should be fine, he will get a reduced PES status meaning that he will not need to do strenuous physical activity if he is limited by his condition (eg he might end up in an admin/desk job)",

Personally, as a monogamous person, I'd consider going to KTV as cheating even if it was just \"touching only\". Most people in SG ~are~ (or say they are) in monogamous relationships, and I'd imagine most of your bf's friends are too. So it'd be interesting to see if they'd be OK with their own gf or wife stepping outside their marriage and rubbing up other men even if there is no penetration and since it's \"all just physical, there's no emotions or feelings involved\" lor. (The answer is, most probably not, because double standards.)\n\nUltimately, it's between just you and your bf to decide, define and maintain the boundaries of your two's own relationship. Whether it's OK for one person to go to such lup sup places and if go, maximum can only drink and lap dance etc; or cannot go entirely. And if either of you fall short, then reconsider the relationship especially for the sake of your sexual and mental health.",

Is that normal? Maybe for them. I just asked him a simple question, what if his kids learn about their agreement in the future? \n\nIs that the kind of environment and role model he wish to set for his kids? He just lowered his head and didnt say anything. I just told him I'm not saying what is right or wrong, I'm just asking questions to guide his thoughts. \n\nSometimes what they do might not reflect with how they feel. But they dont know how to cope with stress, all kinds, and just find an easy way out. \n\nSome marriage is just for convenience, husband give money and wife dont care about anything. \n\nSo no point going around asking what others are doing and mimic them. \n\nDecide what kind of relationship you want, decide how you wish to be treated, and decide what kind of future you want. \n\nI can share personally, that I am a man, and I frequent such places when I was single. I stopped when I have a girlfriend. \n\nWhenever I quarrel with my 1st girlfriend, it is very easy to just spend an evening in KTV to feel better. Same goes when I am having a bad day. \n\nAfter awhile, I realised my relationship with my 1st girlfriend isn't healthy. When I have a bad day and I tell her about it, she should try and make me feel better. I should want to find her whenever I feel stress. \n\nI am not suggesting total reliance. But as your partner, both should support one another. I feel the relationship was not balanced, or rather, I feel it was not healthy for me. Saying nice things and making each other life should be reciprocal. Mutual social reliance. \n\nAnother thing is that the bond you create with your male friends, brother brothers, is difficult to replicate outside KTV. It's like army bond, but the negative kind.\n\nWhen I got my 2nd girlfriend, I stopped going casually entirely. They still invited me for special occasion birthday celebration, I still attend but I don't call any girl. \n\nBut with my 2nd girlfriend, I dont feel the urge or need to call for KTV girls. All I can think of is how she would feel if she found out I was hugging another girl. \n\nDont get me wrong, the temptation was still very strong. The girls in KTV are dressed to kill. Their makeup and figure all are specifically chosen to entice the man. And they know their way around men. \n\nWhat kind of man like what kind of personality. And they are super willing to do this service, because they are getting paid and only have to do it for a few hours. Imagine having to please your men non stop, say nice things and be totally demure. It's exhausting I would imagine. \n\nAs for the dabao to hotel, I feel that's basically cheating. Like sexual relationship with any girl other than my girlfriend should be considered that. \n\nYou need to talk with him, how long and often he needs it. How he likes it. How big is his appetite. Try your best to fulfil his needs. \n\nAs long as you communicate and do these things, it should not be difficult. \n\nI told my girlfriend, if whenever and whoever needs it, they just have to communicate and the other needs to be there. No questions asked. \n\nSo try and find someone more in tune with your needs. If 1 is special manic and needs it daily, the other is 1 time per month, the relationship bound to have cheating. \n\nMaybe love could overcome it, make the person who needs daily or 1 time monthly to change habit. But I would say it is easier to find someone suitable. Make your life easier.",

I don't understand why need to drag religion into it. \n\nI have been to many acclaimed restaurants only to feel underwhelmed and cannot understand the price premium and accolades. But it doesn't mean that the food is bad, just that it is not my taste. \n\nThe fact is that operating under the bazaar type environment will inevitably lead to food of not that high quality. Similar to bak kwa sold during CNY and why I never buy bak kea during CNY. \n\nThe reason there is a banner like that is probably due to the fact that if more and more people talk about how overpriced and not good the food is in such bazaar, then less stores will be opened in the next one organised. Ultimately the interest of the bazaar organisers are affected. \n\nThe solution to this whole incident is relatively simple, the rental for the land usage to be reduced to the bare minimum and by regulation, once an organiser has successfully bidded for the usage to have a rental margin of no more than 20%. If the initial price is low enough then the stores coming in will not have to charge such high prices or can increase the food quality, the bad reviews would still be present but the crowds would then make their own judgement. \n\nThe problem is the entire government thinks that they are Goldman Sachs and use market price principles as their basis without any accountability tied to market. So all kena squeezed down the value chain. When the bidding process is the type of highest bidder wins means that the entire experience will likely be expensive. \n\nWe can experiment on the basis of the bidding based on the lowest bid with clear pricing of store rentals, food unit prices and then maybe we can see the difference it brings. \n\nFor clarity, I don't go to these places as I don't like crowds but the way prices are charged for things like potatoes and small beef cubes are crazy imo. \n\nThe government cannot want it all, they want the festive spirit but want to make money from the land usage. They want affordable but want to charge for everything. This is like a gold digging bitch like the Chinese say, 既要又要还要。Where got this type of thing in the world one?",

I wanted something that actually models how retirement planning works *here*.\n\n# What it does\n\n[sgfireplanner.com](https://sgfireplanner.com) is a comprehensive FIRE planner tailored to Singapore residents.\n\n**Singapore-specific modelling**\n\n* **CPF** — age-bracket contribution rates, OA/SA/MA tracking, extra interest on first $60K, BRS/FRS/ERS projections, CPF LIFE payouts\n* **SRS** — tax deduction impact, balance tracking, drawdown planning\n* **Income tax** — SG progressive brackets (0%–24%), personal reliefs (earned income, NSman, spouse, child, parent, CPF, SRS)\n* **Property** — BSD/ABSD calculations, Bala's Table leasehold decay, LTV, HDB monetisation strategies, downsizing analysis\n* **Healthcare** — MediShield Life, Integrated Shield Plans, CareShield LIFE, out-of-pocket cost projections by age\n\n**Income &amp; expense modelling**\n\n* 3 salary projection models (simple, career-phase, MOM data-driven benchmarks)\n* Multiple income streams (salary, rental, dividends, business, CPF LIFE)\n* Life events (promotions, career breaks, parent support obligations)\n* Year-by-year projection table showing exactly how your finances evolve\n\n**Simulation &amp; stress testing**\n\n* **Monte Carlo simulation** — 10,000 randomised market scenarios with 3 methods (parametric, historical bootstrap, fat-tail Student-t)\n* **Historical backtesting** — test your plan against every rolling window since 1928 (97 years of actual market data)\n* **Sequence risk stress testing** — see how your plan holds up under 8 historical crises (GFC, Asian Financial Crisis, COVID crash, etc.) with mitigation strategies (bond tent, cash buffer, flexible spending)\n\n**12 withdrawal strategies — way beyond the 4% rule**\n\n* Constant Dollar (4% Rule), Variable Percentage (VPW), Guardrails (Guyton-Klinger), Vanguard Dynamic, CAPE-Based, Floor &amp; Ceiling, Percent of Portfolio, 1/N Remaining Years, Sensible Withdrawals, 95% Rule, Endowment (Yale), and Hebeler Autopilot II\n* Side-by-side comparison so you can see how each performs\n\n**8 asset classes**\n\n* US Equities, SG Equities (STI), International (MSCI), Bonds, REITs, Gold, Cash, CPF\n* Pre-built allocation templates or build your own\n* Correlation matrix, Markowitz portfolio stats, glide path configuration\n\n**Dashboard &amp; other features**\n\n* FIRE number, progress tracking, years to FIRE\n* \"What if\" analysis, one-more-year impact\n* Risk assessment across 6 dimensions\n* Passive income breakdown for post-retirement\n* 3 onboarding pathways (goal-first, story-first, already FIRE)\n* Simple and Advanced modes — start simple, go deep when ready\n* JSON export/import, Excel export\n* Comprehensive reference guide with ELI5 explanations\n* Retirement preparation checklist\n\n# A note on accuracy\n\nFull transparency — this was vibe-coded with the help of [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code). The formulas are based on official sources (CPF Board, IRAS, URA, MOM) and I've eyeballed the numbers to check that the math looks right, but I haven't formally audited every calculation path. If you spot anything that looks off — a CPF rate that's wrong, a tax bracket that doesn't match, a simulation result that seems fishy — please let me know. Bug reports and corrections are genuinely appreciated and will help make this more reliable for everyone.\n\n# Privacy\n\nThis is a fully client-side app. There is no backend server, no database, no user accounts, and no tracking. All computation runs in your browser using a Web Worker. Your financial data is stored in your browser's localStorage and never transmitted anywhere. You can verify this yourself — the network tab will show zero data being sent.\n\n# Always free. Open source.\n\nThis will always be **free**. No premium tier, no paywalls, no \"sign up for advanced features.\" I built this because I wanted a proper tool for my own planning, and I believe everyone in Singapore should have access to comprehensive retirement planning without paying for it.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nI'm not a financial advisor and this tool is not financial advice. It's built for educational and planning purposes only — to help you explore scenarios and understand how different assumptions affect your retirement projections.\n\n# Feedback welcome\n\nI'd really appreciate any feedback that can make this more useful — whether it's a feature you wish it had, a UX improvement, or a bug. Drop a comment here or DM me. This is very much a community tool, and I want it to serve the community well.\n\n**Link:** [sgfireplanner.com](https://sgfireplanner.com)",

I’d want to be more conservative on my global ETFs return as well, i feel 8% is a bit too optimistic (for me). \n\n2) I don’t quite understand how to interpret the number of years to full FIRE. If I key in retirement age as 58 and it tells me I can fire at 41, is it referring to coast fire? Even if I select my option as standard fire? I definitely don’t think my portfolio is sufficient for full fire at 41 assuming 3% swr so something seems off somewhere… not sure if you get what I mean.\n\nOk so I adjusted my retirement age to 41 then it tells me I receive financial independence at 41 but portfolio depletes at 85.

Had a really rough 2025, with being jobless and series of medical costs and a failed business, it drained my entire networth of $100k with medical being the main cost. So here I am, at 28 hitting a financial reset. I'm not financially savvy at all so i'd like to seek advice.\n\nI am only a diploma holder in hospitality and make roughly $3.6k before cpf. No debts, no dependants, living with parents and parents very fortunately doesnt expect me to give them any money. I've always been a good saver and have a pretty healthy relationship with money overall.\n\nIn 2024, I signed an endowment plan at $300/mth and an ILP at $700/mth (huge mistake, i know😭). I plan to surrender my endowment with $0 surrender value as it's honestly not that huge a sum and i value opportunity cost more going forward. I also plan to reduce my ILP premium to just $300/mth, current valuation sitting at ~$16k. \n\nWith that, i should be able to aggressively invest about $1.2k comfortably every month. I have a time horizon of 20-25 years and can stomach drawdowns from -40% to -50%. \n\nAfter doing my research, i've built my own portfolio and it looks like this:\n\n40% VTI\n30% QQQM\n15% VHT\n15% VXUS\n\nLogic is that the trend seems to be moving towards heavily on tech and healthcare. And i want maximum growth since i can stomach the big drawdowns. I also plan to divert my ILP to a more moderate risk portfolio to cushion my risk. I'm a citizen so i naturally have CPF as a guaranteed risk-free basket. \n\nAm i missing anything? Or does my ETFs pick not make sense? \n\nAny advice is greatly appreciated, thanks in advance!!!",

Our cards were declined so we paid for our items in cash instead. Today morning, my friend woke up and found out he had 2 transactions for the same amount on his card. I didn’t have though. The difference was that I used my physical card while he used Apple Wallet. Each transaction costed the same 6000 yen. When we went back to the store this morning to attempt to get a refund it wasn’t possible. When trying to use the app to report, the app stated the payment was “authorised and secure” as he used Apple Pay, leading to only a “I understood” button or “suspend card” button. This is making him very frustrated, especially since we can’t call the hotline.\n\nWhat is the likelihood of a refund? We have the receipt for the 6000 yen item paid in cash.

Today my account stands at $275k. \n\nWhy i contributed so early even though the tax savings is not substantial is because I always knew i intend to have kids and hence may not need to use the srs tool for long (wmcr). I thought if I just contributed up to $200k, I should still be within the $400k withdrawal cap without incurring tax. What i did not expect was that I had underestimated the performance of my investments and how contributing srs too early doesn't just affect your ability to use srs in your later, higher income years, but also the longer time invested means much higher returns at withdrawal.\n\nNow I think if my portfolio were to continue this trajectory, the taxes I am going to incur at withdrawal could possibly negate whatever tax savings I made earlier from contributing to it.\n\nAnother thing I did not consider was my intention to retire early. I find that I am working out my finances to quit my job now based on what is outside of SRS/CPF and by the time I can access my SRS at 62, my expenses would have reduced with no dependents by then.

SRS seems powerful because withdrawals are spread over just 10 years. If structured properly, it can cover a meaningful portion of living expenses during that window.\n\nWould you plan to fully draw down SRS to zero over those 10 years? Or pace it more conservatively?\n\n1. The timing between SRS and CPF LIFE feels slightly misaligned. SRS penalty-free withdrawals start at 63, but CPF LIFE payouts begin at 65 (earliest). That creates a 2-year gap.\n\nWas this intentional policy design? Or just historical layering of schemes?\n\n1. Because of that timing difference, some retirement years feel more “secure” than others with SRS or CPF LIFE payouts reducing the need for investment drawdowns.\n\nPost-65 looks relatively stable under current policies. The real challenge seems to be retiring earlier (say 55) and bridging the 55–65 gap.\n\nWhich brings me to CPF OA.\n\nHow do you think about managing OA in retirement planning?  \n• Regular withdrawal?  \n• Lump sum withdrawal and invest externally?  \n• Leave it untouched as a conservative buffer?\n\nCurious how others are structuring this?\n\nSeparately, I built a small tool to model CPF LIFE and SRS projections while exploring these questions.

      "selftext": "Repost because Reddit automatically removed my post (*probably due to external link*)\n\nPlease DM me if you would like the link to try out.\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is my first posting here -\n\nThis is version 3 of my (free) personal finance app first released 3 weeks ago, after listening to feedbacks from u/Kyith, cryptypudgy, Ed, Ra and others (with help of AI). Please let me know if you would like to see more features, or if there are any errors.\n\nThere is the option to input multiple insurance policies, CPF (BRS, FRS, ERS) , one-time spike events and also modelling the sequence of returns through different historical periods in **both the US and in Singapore.**\n\nI previously shared it in my telegram group chat but was told to share it here to benefit more folks.\n\n\n\n**1. Multiple Insurance Policies Input**\n\nYou can enter details for more than one insurance policy you hold — including premiums, coverage types, and cash values — so the projection accounts for insurance-related financial flows over time.\n\nThis helps in modelling how life/health/other insurance affects your net worth and cashflow.\n\n\n\n**2. CPF Modelling (Singapore-Specific)**\n\nThe tool includes CPF (Central Provident Fund) projections, allowing you to account for:\n\nCPF balances by account (OA, SA, RA, etc.)\n\nAge-based milestones like BRS, FRS, and ERS\n\nHow CPF balances grow over time\n\nThis makes the projections tailored to Singapore residents.\n\n\n\n**3. One-Time Events &amp; Spike Modelling**\n\nYou can add single large events such as:\n\nLump-sum gifts or inheritances\n\nInheritances\n\nOne-off expenses like big medical bills\n\nCareer breaks or sudden expense spikes\n\nThis enriches the projection beyond constant yearly inputs.\n\n\n\n**4. Sequence of Returns Modelling**\n\nInstead of assuming one fixed growth rate forever, the projector lets you simulate what happens if returns vary year-by-year — including using historical return sequences from Singapore or the US market.\n\nThat’s important because how returns occur over time — especially early in retirement — can drastically change outcomes.\n\n\n\n**5. Withdrawal &amp; Retirement Runway Projections**\n\nThe app models how your portfolio can be drawn down in retirement using different strategies, so you can see:\n\n📍 How long your savings may last\n\n📍 How different withdrawal rules affect sustainability\n\nIt allows you to experiment with different approaches to withdrawing assets over time.\n\n\n\n**6. Monte Carlo / Historical Stress Testing**\n\nSome versions include simulations and historical stress tests, where your plan is tested against different market return scenarios — including severe downturns — to see how resilient your finances might be.\n\nWhile this feature may not be full Monte Carlo yet in every build, historical sequence testing is definitely part of it.\n\n\n\n**7. CPF &amp; Cashflow Timeline**\n\nThe app shows a timeline of how your CPF balances and other financial elements evolve year by year based on your inputs, giving you a clear picture of future wealth trajectory.\n\nThis is similar in concept to much more complex financial plans but simplified for personal modelling.\n\n  \nPlease let me know if you would like to see more features/apps in future!\n\nThank you. \n\n  \nSG Faiya\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ycppcjni5ulg1.jpg?width=2886&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02c7b219a59d56692c0c4466d16923c8e763ea5c\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t6j2dnni5ulg1.jpg?width=1885&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef38b0b531b0e42ba08817067b240c1ae01c462f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/295ovkni5ulg1.jpg?width=1947&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76c8bad41f613fd13f4828f546d838de0b8379f4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0xo8kmni5ulg1.jpg?width=2077&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e04ba12c6521ecca20f5545c60a5982f49b1c08d\n\n  \n",

Since im not Singaporean, my company is paying me what they would pay a Singaporean into a CPF into an SRS account at DBS instead. I would like to put my money to work with US Stocks like GOOG and Irish domiciled ETFs like CSPX or VUAG. I haven't been able to figure out how to do that. Calling, visiting or even meeting with DBS has proven useless. They are interested in talking about selling me super high fee mutual funds or insurance products. I want to self manage and just buy low cost ETFs or stocks. According to my company, I am not allowed to use a different bank for the SRS.\n\n1)  I am told, I might be able to buy US stocks and ETFs in the SRS if I open a DBS Vickers account but no one can confirm for sure, is this the way? Any costs? Is there a better way?\n\n2) Can I move the money from DBS SRS to another SRS that's easier to invest in while keeping the DBS one open so that I can receive new money every month? If so, which bank? Any fees?\n\n3) Anything else I should be aware of? Or things to look out for?\n",

There is no difference where this account sits. They all operate the same way.\n\n  \nBrokerage = account where you can buy stocks / ETFs. DBS Vickers is DBS's version of a brokerage account. The brokerage account provider and SRS account provider do not need to be the same. Also, do not use DBS Vickers for SRS investing as fees are ridiculous. What you can invest in depends on your brokerage account.\n\n  \nSo what you need now is to find a brokerage that can support SRS investing. The most common ones are POEMS and Stashaway. For Singapore, you generally can't find a good way to invest SRS funds into single stocks like GOOG but LSE ETFs are more easily accessible. Typical investments for SRS funds include the Amundi World Unit Trust (similar to SWRD) via POEMs and Amundi US Trust (similar to CSPX I believe) via POEMs. Note that these are Unit Trusts, not ETFs.\n\n\n\nStashway recently introduced a new product called ETF Explorer where you can buy ETFs directly via their platform at a 1 USD fee. You have access to ISAC, which is again similar to SWRD via this route.",
