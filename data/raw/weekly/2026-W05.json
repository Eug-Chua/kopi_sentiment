          "text": "It’s a classic \"grass is greener\" scenario: standing on a crowded North-South Line platform, watching a train stop at every single station, and wishing we had the express tracks of New York or Tokyo.\nBut in a city-state as compact as Singapore, the \"express\" dream is complicated. Does it improve connectivity? The answer is a nuanced \"Yes, but with massive trade-offs.\"\nHere is a critical assessment of why express trains aren't a simple \"ctrl+c, ctrl+v\" solution for Singapore.\n1. The Engineering Wall: The \"Two-Track\" Trap\nMost of Singapore’s MRT lines (NSL, EWL, NEL, DTL) are dual-tracked. To run an express train that skips stops, you need a way for the fast train to overtake the slow one.\n * The Problem: Without a third or fourth track (\"quad-tracking\"), an express train would just get stuck behind the local train ahead of it. It’s like a Ferrari trapped behind a tractor on a single-lane road.\n * The Cost: Building extra tracks underground in a land-scarce city is astronomically expensive. It requires wider tunnels, more land acquisition, and complex station designs.\n2. The \"Skip-Stop\" Penalty: A Social Equity Issue\nConnectivity isn't just about speed (v = \\frac{d}{t}); it’s about access.\nIn Singapore, the government prioritizes the \"15-minute town, 45-minute city\" goal. If we introduced express trains on existing lines, residents at smaller stations (like Khatib or Yio Chu Kang) might see their train frequency drop, effectively reducing their connectivity to improve it for those in Jurong or Woodlands.\n3. The Geometry of a Tiny Island\nExpress trains thrive when distances between stops are 5–10 km (like regional rail in Europe). In Singapore:\n * Average MRT station distance is roughly 1 to 1.5 km.\n * The train barely reaches its top speed before it has to start braking for the next station.\n * Verdict: For many routes, the \"time saved\" by skipping three stations might only be 4–5 minutes—hardly worth the billions in infrastructure.\n4. Where Express Actually Works in Singapore\nThe Land Transport Authority (LTA) isn't ignoring the idea; they are just applying it where it makes sense:\n * Cross Island Line (CRL): Designed with higher speeds and the potential for \"skip-stop\" patterns because it covers long, suburban-to-suburban distances.\n * RTS Link (Singapore-JB): A \"point-to-point\" express that solves a specific bottleneck.\n * The Hub-and-Spoke Model: Instead of express trains, Singapore uses Bus Integrated Hubs. High-capacity \"trunk\" MRT lines act as the spine, while feeders provide the \"capillaries.\" The Reality Check: Connectivity in Singapore is often measured by \"First and Last Mile\" ease. An express train that saves you 10 minutes doesn't help if you then have to wait 15 minutes for a feeder bus in the rain. Critical Verdict\nExpress trains do improve connectivity for the long-distance commuter, but in a high-density city-state, they often degrade connectivity for the average commuter by reducing frequency at intermediate stops.\nFor Singapore, the \"win\" isn't necessarily faster trains, but a denser network. The more \"loops\" (like the Circle Line and Cross Island Line) we have, the more direct paths become available, which naturally reduces travel time without needing to skip stops.",

      "selftext": "SINGAPORE – Senior management at a software company wanted to remove the head of a sales team from his role after he sent aggressive e-mails attacking another team leader and refused to apologise to her.\n\nBut SAP Asia decided to place Mr Prashant Mudgal on a 45-day performance improvement plan (PIP) before terminating his employment in 2019.\n\nThis decision was described as a “farce” by a High Court judge, who said the company had prejudged him and did not give him a genuine opportunity to improve.\n\nMr Mudgal, a foreign national, sued his former employer for nearly $5 million in loss of earnings from 2020 until May 31, 2025.\n\nOn Jan 21, Justice Dedar Singh Gill awarded him $1,000 in nominal damages, rejecting his contention that the company’s conduct caused him to suffer “crippling” financial losses.\n\nIn his written judgment, he recognised the implied term of mutual trust and confidence.\n\nIt is a rule in English common law that requires both employer and employee to act in a way that does not destroy or seriously damage the mutual trust and confidence between them.\n\nThe judge said SAP breached the term by behaving in an “intolerable or wholly unacceptable” way because it placed Mr Mudgal on the PIP even though it had the endgame of terminating his employment in mind.\n\n“In so doing, the defendant had prejudged the claimant and misled him into thinking that he was being given a genuine opportunity to improve his conduct and/or performance when this was not the case,” he added.\n\nJustice Gill noted that SAP had an “easy means” of dealing with Mr Mudgal by invoking the termination clause in the employment agreement.\n\n“Yet, this was not the remedy that the defendant immediately availed itself to. It imposed a farce of the PIP on the claimant,” he said.\n\nThe company is the Singapore-incorporated subsidiary of a German multinational corporation that develops software systems to manage business operations.\n\nMr Mudgal was head of services sales in the Asia-Pacific and Japan region for a line of cloud-based management software. He had a strained relationship with Ms Otsakchon Raman, head of services delivery for the same line of business in the Asia-Pacific and Japan and Greater China regions.\n\nThe events leading up to his termination centred on two incidents.\n\nOne incident in July 2018 arose from the transfer of a staff member, who was working on an ongoing project in India, from Ms Raman’s team to Mr Mudgal’s team.\n\nA series of e-mail exchanges between Ms Raman and a member of Mr Mudgal’s team led him to send an abrasive e-mail to Ms Raman, accusing her team of “gross incompetence”.\n\nAnother dispute in October 2018 over project timelines led Mr Mudgal to send an e-mail, with senior management copied, in which he attacked Ms Raman’s leadership and integrity.\n\nHe refused to apologise when asked to do so.\n\nIn November 2018, Ms Charmaine Seabury, the global vice-president of services sales, told human resources business partner Adele Teo-Gomez that there was “full alignment” among senior leaders on removing Mr Mudgal.\n\nOver a month, Ms Teo-Gomez and others from the employee relations department discussed the various options with Ms Seabury.\n\nMr Mudgal was formally placed on the PIP between March 21 and May 5 in 2019.\n\nOn Oct 25, 2019, Ms Seabury made it known that she wanted his employment to be terminated “as soon as possible”, saying that there were still issues with his conduct.\n\nThe notice of termination was served on Mr Mudgal on Nov 21. It stated that he would be placed on garden leave and that his last day would be Dec 31.\n\nThe judge said the evidence made it clear that Mr Mudgal was prejudged, pointing to the e-mails sent among various individuals including Ms Seabury, Ms Teo-Gomez and Ms Raman.\n\nPrior to Mr Mudgal being placed on the PIP, there were individuals within the management who were adamant about removing him from the company’s employment as soon as possible, he noted.\n\nJustice Gill said Mr Mudgal was never given a genuine opportunity to improve. “The attitude which Ms Seabury bore towards the claimant, namely her desire to terminate his employment as soon as possible, persisted even after she formally placed him on the PIP,” he added.\n\nHe noted that barely one month into the PIP, Ms Seabury told Ms Teo-Gomez that “we do not believe these changes in behaviour will be maintained” and that “we would like to remove him from the business as soon as possible”.\n\nThe judge added, however, that Mr Mudgal failed to show that his loss of future earnings flowed from the company’s conduct.\n\nMr Mudgal arrived at the figure of nearly $5 million by applying a “conservative” 10 per cent uplift to his annual future earnings from his last-drawn annual income of $665,673 in 2019, less his earnings to-date of $50,000. He claimed he has been unable to find employment despite applying for more than 300 jobs from 2020 to 2023.\n\nJustice Gill said: “I fail to see how (SAP’s) conduct would have had any bearing on (Mr Mudgal’s) employability in the labour market, much less caused him ‘irreparable damage to his ability to secure gainful employment’.”\n\nHe added that it was objectively easy to see how and why Mr Mudgal’s “self-righteous and unyielding behaviour” contributed to the hostility in an already volatile environment between the two teams.\n\n“He was, to a large extent, the author of his own misfortunes that culminated in the termination of his employment,” said Justice Gill.\n\n“The outcome of this case may well be a Pyrrhic victory for the claimant, but I hope that it will provide him with some vindication and allow him to move on with his life.”\n\nThe judge said the facts of this case showed why the implied term of mutual trust and confidence is needed. “There is nothing irreconcilable between the right to bring an employment relationship to an end and the duty not to behave in an intolerable or wholly unacceptable way,” he said.\n\nhttps://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/ex-employee-who-sued-software-firm-sap-for-5m-over-termination-gets-1000-in-pyrrhic-victory",

My mom was diagnosed at just 37, well before the typical screening age of 45–50. Because of her, I went for my screening at SGH at 27, with a referral from my GP. They found a polyp, and removed it. Imagine if I didn’t get checked, that polyp might turn cancerous. ‼️Everyone seems obsessed with protein these days, but you know what’s even more important? Fibre. Your body NEEDS it. Ideally, you should be able to have a bowel movement daily, or at least 3–4 times a week. Many of my relatives with colorectal cancer had diets heavy in meat and seafood (our family dinners were seafood and meat heavy!!). Fibre not only helps you feel full and gives you energy, but it also promotes healthy gut bacteria. YOU NEED TO UP YOUR FIBRE INTAKE.",

As expected, there are road closures and motorists are advised to take alternative routes. Our Indian friends have been celebrating Thaipusam for many years already.\n\nI was discussing with a coworker, and he mentioned he was quite relieved that it falls on a Sunday this year, so he doesn’t need to take leave. And it would be nice if everyone could get one more public holiday, since Chinese and Malays already have two religious holidays each.\n\nWhy hasn’t Thaipusam been made a public holiday by now ? When it falls on a weekday, many people take leave anyway, which affects productivity regardless. Wouldn’t it make more sense to just formalise it as a PH ?\n\nAlso, Vesak Day is celebrated by Buddhists, who are mostly Chinese. I'm yet to meet a Indian Buddhist so I’m not entirely sure why Vesak Day is grouped under Indian holiday. Might be there in other countries. Happy to be corrected on this.\n\nAlso there is another festival pongul for Indians which is celebrated for a few days. Atleast give us 1 more PH la.\n\nCurious to hear what others think.\n\nEdit : I understand there are many other Indian communities other than Tamil. Respect that. I want to focus on Thaipusam since it is widely known.\n\nEdit : like someone mentioned I won't be surprised we might get a founder's day before we get another PH for Indians lol.",

This means lots of t-shirts. When Singaporeans holiday overseas, we don't have a lot of cold weather wear, and to save money, we often buy 1 big down jacket and/or buy as few garments as possible that can be used in the widest range of temperatures. This also means we often end up looking a little off-season. Big puffy down jackets in autumn, wearing t-shirts underneath the overcoat, layering like mad to make up for a lack of a good sweater or what. As opposed to local people who have garments that are suited/styled precisely to that weather, so when put next to locals who are very appropriately and fashionably dressed to that weather, we kind of stick out a little. Even in summer, foreigners don't just chiong tshirts/singlets and shorts. Some of the non-tropical countries opt for more sun protection rather than just wearing as little as possible.

Look... \"staying out till late\" and \"going on a solo trip\",are not the same thing. They are definitely \"quite different\". That said, I think your other trips are much more relevant, so focus on those. Consider the differences in those experiences:\n1. Length - were the other trips also of similar length? Every extra day is extra planning to be done.\n2. Destination - are those countries particularly safer? Or, nearer/easier to get to? What are the people typically like? \n3. Activities - did the trips revolve around city areas, or was there often terrain / environmental danger involved? \n4. Emergency plan - in the event of emergency, what's the plan? Who can you call, and who can your parents call? If there's a good difference in any of these questions, then that's probably what they're focused on. Otherwise, if your previous trips are very similar, you can try to drill down on what exactly is it that gives them so much pause. So that’s why I was disappointed that they didn’t trust me enough. It's often not you. As any driver will tell you, the biggest hazard on the road is \"other drivers\". The best driver in the world can still get into an accident as long as there's one other reckless person. They may not doubt your skill and independence, but rather the things/people that you are exposing yourself to. But again, although I think that it's bullshit to make such a big threat out of \"love\", the fact is that people won't always say what they mean, and strangers will be even worse to tourists.",

Will Singaporeans ever have something that maybe not even all, but at least most Singaporeans are proud of?\n\nSIA is probably the biggest international name but Singaporeans openly criticize it for the current high prices and 'drop in standards'. I'm guessing something in the luxury segment like SIA is, will struggle to capture the mass population of singapore\n\nFood wise I can only think of Ya Kun and Tiger beer, but I don't think neither brand really leans into national pride and I also often see people ranting about how much the price of ya kun has gone up.\n\nOn the flip side, whenever there are new local business that start up, I often see comments like 'confirm close after a year'.

Not only that but the overall vibe felt insanely relaxed compared to what I'm used to. Way less honking, if any honking, drivers using turn signals and not flying all over the place, pedestrians were more respectful of each other and people seemed friendlier and less aggressive. In Chicago it's normal for people to use their horn to communicate pretty much anything. Even if they're just annoyed to be sitting in traffic they sometimes will lay on their horn to express that. Or if one person holds up other drivers, seemingly everyone behind them will lay on their horn, and oftentimes yell at them when going past. Also, I heard some people say Singapore is really dense, so I expected it to feel dense. But it didn't feel that dense to me at all. If anything it felt very spacious, green and like you had tons of breathing room everywhere.\n\nThe most recent US city I lived in was Chicago, and compared to Singapore, Chicago feels massive and everything is way closer together. Chicago feels about 4-5x bigger and denser than Singapore in just about every way, and like there's much less room to breathe. So, how does Singapore achieve this? I thought it was lovely.\n\nI'm used to things being this close together everywhere outside of downtown\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/skyscrapers/comments/1icnhl6/chicago_aerial_view/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button",

Singapore from about fifty years ago looked very different (more chaotic and messed-up) because zoning was then inconsistently applied or not fully enforced.",

I think a big difference is that the density peaks far higher in the US. There is a very dense downtown core with almost no residents that quickly spreads out into suburban sprawl. In Singapore, the business and commercial districts are less dense, which makes the densest areas feel more spacious, and conversely there isn't suburban sprawl, so even the most spread out areas feel comparable to or a little denser than an inner suburb like Evanston. It's also in part because Singapore operates more like what one might consider to be far bigger cities, like NYC, in that there are secondary business and commercial districts. I don't know Chicago specifically that well here, but in general in the US I'm used to needing to go downtown a lot. Singaporeans generally don't go to the CBD except to work because things are somewhat spread out around the island into a few other clusters as well. This is somewhat deliberate, as many \"towns\" in Singapore are designed to be somewhat self-contained for daily living. Having trees and parks also goes a long way. This is deliberate policy, without which much of the green space would be \"optimised away\", and everything would feel far denser.",

Often, I clear paperwork on the weekends as well. My only reprieve is aiming to sleep 8 hours every day and occasionally spending time with my friends/partner.  Wake up, work, after work eat, come back sleep. No time for much else.\n\nI'm worried about burnout, both physically and mentally but can't quit because this is the best paying job in my field for a degree and I'm not remotely ready to do a Masters. Not to mention bond. I also don't want to burnout as it'll affect the quality of my work, something I cannot (afford to) compromise on.\n\nThe job gives me satisfaction and I leave everyday fulfilled, but dead tired and frustrated as I can't exactly enjoy my hobbies of gaming as weekends are often burnt planning for the week ahead or catching up on paperwork. I don't have time to exercise unless I cut gaming completely, which I don't exactly want to either.\n\nI know this sounds like a \"woe is me\" post but I'm not sure how better to cope.

They also shared that I chose this job and it's \"life\". My partner is just as frustrated to the point the response is usually \"haiz... What can we do?\" Or \"well...\"\n\nEdit Edit: Genuinely appreciate all of the comments thus far. I really can't quit due to bond, and as mentioned in my comment, I'm only earning 4.5k which is not a lot (I'm already beating myself up earning this little at 30), while industry average (GOD BLESS) is 3k or lesser, with many of my former classmates struggling greatly to find work as it is saturated.

Last week, I had been called in for a performance review to be put on PRP.\n\nGranted I am not a stellar performer, but I do my job diligently and try my best. In the first year, I think I was not performing up to standard according to my boss and was asked what are the reasons. I explained that I think there is a job mismatch but I will try my best to learn. However, I find the directions given to me very vague and a lot of times, I just could not nail it. My boss also mentioned that when she hired me, she thought that I am well-versed in handling media. However, I mostly did events  where some were quite high profile and were covered by medias. I guess it is on me that I thought that those were the same as media engagement.\n\nAfter 6 months, I realised that the scope of work is totally off and anything I proposed were just getting shot down. After that, I lost confidence and kept a low profile. I began doing menial tasks, get heavily involved in other department's work. after 1.5 years, I really just cant seem to get the grip of things.\n\nThat said, my bosses were not great, in fact, the entire department were complaining and looking for other job themselves. Naturally, I started the same and was lucky that I scored some interviews. Recently, I have a few second round interviews with other ministries/agencies, and am waiting for official offer.\n\nHowever, last week's performance review came, and they say that my grading will be recorded and it would be shared throughout the entire government record. They indirectly advise me to leave asap but I was adamant to stay for the bonus. We ended with that I will resign when I qualify for my bonus, which when she said to me that my \"bad\" grading would be included and stay in government records forever, and I better secure the offer before its being included as it would affect my future opportunities.\n\nAlso, not to play the blame game, my bosses are getting absolutely pummeled by the senior management team. Our senior management also commented that the middle management (my bosses) are not up to standard, which further validates my view that as much as I am not up to standard, they cannot just pin all the blames on me alone...\n\nLet say in worse case scenario, I get Ds/Es, how screwed am I? Also, I am afraid that once the PRP sets in, HR would inform my potential new hiring agency/ministry that I am currently on PRP and drop me after HR checks... thanks in advance!\n\n*Edit: My bosses also claimed to have provided email coaching, which for the record, I do not receive much. There is not even face to face consultation. When she asked for a piece of work, I would complete it, check through with my colleague (who is supposedly the best performer) and get her green light. But she will come back with not good enough etc. I have recorded and documented our last 3 months email exchanges and I am quite sure not one is a 'coaching' email... Heck, what is 'receiving coaching through emails' anyway???",

Today my pay is much much higher and I am very valued in the current company - the old place? Still doing things the same old way. Took me only a year+ to figure out the misfit and take action to correct it. Anyone who complains about their bosses and takes no action themselves, have only themselves to blame. If one is truly good, you will find your value somewhere, or, find what is valued and learn it to be of value to others. Also based on your actions, hiding elsewhere, doing menial tasks, doing (unrecognised) work for other departments, you have yet to learn needed basic workplace skills. Your bosses are mediocre but you have your ownself to blame for much of the current predicament.",

The debt repayment scheme allows you to manage the debt but musn't be more than 5 years. So, at best, it would be around $1,677 per month.

You don't know if the car breaks down and how much the repairs would be in the next 10 years or so.

I feel so sick, like i might actually throw up. it didn’t used to affect me this much, but now it’s overwhelming and i can’t stop thinking about what i’m missing.\n\ni’m also really scared about the future. once i graduate and start working, how am i even supposed to make friends then? if i couldn’t do it in uni, how will i do it later? i keep thinking am i just going to die alone?\n\ni’ve also never been in a situationship or a relationship. no one’s ever liked me that way. i really want to experience romance at least once in my life, but i feel like my lack of friends is probably a huge red flag and a turn-off anyway\n\ni don’t really know what i’m looking for by posting this. i guess i just want to know if anyone else feels like this, or if anyone felt this way and things eventually got better. right now it just feels really lonely and permanent.",

Tech industry is incredibly terrible right now due to multiple of factors (e.g. AI, Trump, outsourcing, weaken economic outlook, tech bubble burst, bootcamps) I know a couple of 5 to 10 years veterans who are still jobless for more than a year now. The situation is much more grim for fresh graduates who is now completing with more experienced professionals who is willing to price themselves lower. I also notice the tone from tech recruiters who give career advise have change and become more pessimistic, from \"Just cold call and tailor your resume, you will land a role within months\" to \"Expect not being able to get in the industry for 1 to 2 years\" i applied even to listings up to a month old and i focused on all tech entry level jobs or jobs not directly tech but accepted tech background, these contribute to the high numbers Is good that you apply for adjacent roles, consider applying for roles that need your skills and capabilities, even if is not an even 50% match from your expectations. Here is what I recommend/suggest: Option A - If you really really want to get into tech: A stellar resume. A lot lecturers and some career consultant give shit advise on resume because they have been out of the force for a quite awhile. Avoid those aesthetics resume, I notice a lot of my SWE pals have \"fun\" looking resumes that are very difficult to read for HR/recruiter, so they end up in the discard pile. See what common phases and keywords that is written in the JDs, try to input those keywords organically and tailor it. Use ChatGPT if you need help but DON'T BLINDLY ACCEPT IT, take a scan, it has tendencies input random achievements. Expand your network via hackathons, voluntary, networking events if someone has a connection in a role you are interested in they can refer you in organisations or give you advise. This also shows you are passionate about the field. I landed in my current role, because I met 2 people in a community event, one of them give me tips on what to say for that company and other is the colleague of the interviewer, so they vouched for me. Upskill yourself, show you are passionate and willing to learn. Explain how such skills/courses make you a more valuable employee. \"I learn x software, which means I can assist and read Y\". As you scan the JDs, keep a lookout on common skills and keywords they used. Continue be open to roles is adjacent to the industry and roles you have the skill for, since you need a foot in. Example, data analytic, Quality Assurance, Business Analytics, IT Support etc. Lastly, I want to acknowledge the feeling and the experience you have is valid, the economy for tech is bad.

U have to cater ur resume for the roles u apply. Just sell the shit out of urself even if ur skillsets aren’t as glamorous as it sounds. If u just came out of cs degree, python’s one of the most sought after skills, put that in the resume and maybe a Git link to a sample app, no need for anything fancy. One that demonstrates ur understanding of algorithms and if u have the time which u probably do, design a well structured one. One that caters to the user’s interactions (UX and UI) impresses most. It could be an app or site that only has a basic page with a list of products on it or whatever, and a login page. If u dont have any of that, then i think it’s time to brush or pick up some skills… youtube and chatGpt is a good source to develop one. Interviewers would be interested in ur thought process during the creation of the app/site - why did u design it this way? How did u do this login page or how do u authenticate and authorise the users? Is the site/app scalable? What’s the architectural design behind this (mvc, mvvm etc)? Thats only if u dont have buffed portfolios like 90% of the fresh grads out there… i have some crazy fresh grad friends that participated/won hackathons, interned at some big named companies and/or has personal projects that can blow one’s minds… Make ur resume stand out and highlight ur best points, essentially coming back to my point - sell the shit out of urself.

Meaning, they are able to reflect on their life choices and adjust to changes. They adapt and grow stronger. They put effort into working on what they want to improve on. If they don't own a place and they want a place, they will find a way to get rental or 2 room minimally. They won't look at others who live in prime areas with Instagram interiors and start to envy. If they want to travel, they will adapt their travels to their circumstances and be at peace. It does not matter how much money they have but they have self-respect. They have a mindset full of dignity. They have MY respect. Warning: incoming harsh words. But you're late 30s, so what the point of gentle words? Maybe you're in this mindset because people have been too gentle to you all along. You're in denial, claiming you're not comparing with others. But you use the word \"competitive\" in your post. You feel the pressure, and it's entirely self-inflicted and mental. Stop blaming the environment. The fact that you're complaining that you have no inheritance and then comparing with what the news reported is frankly pathetic. Basically, your post shows that you are bitter and stressed....about not being handed enough money on a platter. You have internalized certain Asian expectations without thinking for yourself despite all those years of education. Secretly, because of this mindset, you judge others according to these milestones and are now turning to judge yourself needlessly. You need therapy.

Try and stay close to home for the time being, so if they get upset by anything, you can bring them back to let them calm down in a familiar environment. If you need to take public transport, than do short distance trips first. Like 2-3 stops, which would be around a 10 minute train ride. Enough to get them slowly familiar with riding the train and it's a short enough trip that they won't get too overstimulated. Also bring them to more outdoor places, like parks and gardens. It'll be quieter and less crowded than a shopping mall. Plus most parks have a playground area so they can burn off energy and distract themselves with playing. Basically don't rush the process. Instead of doing full day trips with cranky children, do a shorter outing in the morning, go home to rest and nap in the afternoon (so you also avoid the worse of this heat), and then spend the evenings somewhere nearby.

We had to attend weekly meetings, which was often hosted by Melvin Lim, and got paid $800 per month as mentioned by the redditor who disclosed everyone’s salaries. Late fee of $10 applicable to interns as well if late for meetings, money requested by events team which goes to pantry supplies. The best thing from this scandal is Marc filling in as Interim CEO. He was a genuinely nice person who gave good feedback and listened to our presentations when our mentor would be sick/apply for leave on our presentation days. Can’t say the same for anyone else there though. Could tell that Carrie the HR person didn’t like interacting with interns as well\n\n(edit: adding on that every week required by mentor to interview 2 agents on their closed cases which was ridiculously hard since theyre too busy to show up/will ghost u online, have to text like 30 of them for example at once to get 2 to reply to u within that wee…waste of time since all information is already recorded previously)",

Lets say you want to rob someone, Peopledo not despise a thiefIf he steals to satisfy himself when he is starving.31Yetwhenhe is found, he must restore sevenfold;He may have to give up all the substance of his house. Proverbs 6:30-31 If the theft is certainly found alive in his hand, whether it is an ox or donkey or sheep, he shall restore double. Exodus 22:4 I understand many non believers like to use this following verse to justify that Christians should always forgive and not retaliate like your comment suggests: “You have heard that it was said, ‘An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.’39But I tell you not to resist an evil person. But whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also.40If anyone wants to sue you and take away your tunic, let him haveyourcloak also.41And whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two.42Give to him who asks you, and from him who wants to borrow from you do not turn away. Matthew 5:38-42 However, the actual interpretation of this verse is to say that the punishment is to be proportional to the crime, rather than an ever-escalating cycle of revenge. Or rather, the proper response to discrimination, mocking, or insults is to simply let it go. That such acts are not worthy of a response. which is ironic now considering i responded to your slight.",

Galatians 6:1 However, before we begin to judge others, we must also remember that we are sinners too. As per the verse below: And why do you look at the speck in your brother’s eye, but do not consider the plank in your own eye?4Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Let me remove the speck from your eye’; and look, a plankisin your own eye?5Hypocrite! First remove the plank from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.

Or at least it isn’t a complete waste of money compared to if you had less. IFAs are often not fee-based, they just sell multiple insurance company products and earn commission, so make sure you don’t use this type. Endowus is a very decent mix of user-friendly with acceptable fees. IBKR is cheapest for many things (including Pimco GIS Income Fund) but not so easy to use. The Pimco GIS Income Fund is a ”bond-focus fund”. The bonds inside are a bit more risky and somehow they use some leverage, so the payouts are higher. There are slightly different “flavours” as well, like Pimco GIS Diversified Income Fund. Money market fund is very safe, but the returns are under 1.5% p.a. now so it won’t help you meet your goal of ~5% p.a. in “dividends”. And don’t get tricked into USD mmf with higher interest because the FX risk will just get you instead. Other products that I think could help you are 1) Allianz Income and Growth (can get thru Endowus for lower fees). This is about 1/3 US equities and 2/3 bonds, but the bonds are the riskier type and half perform more like equities. Read this for a more thorough explanation of pros and cons: https://investmentmoats.com/fund/allianz-income-growth-good-returns-for-past-3-years-sustain-7-income-yield/ 2) Amova Singapore Dividend Equity Fund (can’t  buy directly from Endowus, but you can buy from Poems or Dollardex then transfer to Endowus, and Endowus will let you buy more after that).  This is composed of Singapore stocks and gives out 5% p.a. dividends monthly while doing a pretty good job of maintaining or growing capital. A bit less bank-heavy than the Straits Times Index, and you pay higher fees but they solve the monthly payout problem for you. S-REITs also inside, so it’s good for “dummies”. People will probably tell you to invest in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for the lowest fees, but then you need to sell to create your “dividend”, and it requires more financial literacy.

Yield is high for all classes but is also because it doesn't take into account hedging cost. USDSGD hedging cost now, with how volatile the USD is, probably is >2% p.a., this will come out of your NAV. On yields, well lots of nations now are looking at USD in a different light, even if they do have more rate cuts it's likely the yields won't move much at all, hence it's duration position won't offer much upside. Long story short, NAV likely to erode, your 6% dividend net of fees and hedging cost, is typically closer to 3%, assuming spreads stay tight and yields are constant On AIG the dividend yield stated is not an organic yield. The organic yield of the fund is closer to 2+ 3%, due to its mix of HY bonds, convertibles and equities that are ALL US centric.

So the brain fills the gap with anxiety.\nOne thing I wish I understood earlier: milestones like “1M” or “own place” aren’t destinations. They’re just coordinates along a much longer path.\nAt 28, the most valuable asset you’re building isn’t the 200k. It’s the fact that you’re already on a stable, compounding trajectory.\nThe danger isn’t renting or buying late. It’s letting future goals make the present feel like failure.\nIf I could tell my younger self one thing, it’d be this:\ndon’t judge your life using endgame metrics while you’re still in the accumulation phase.\nYou’re not behind.

Cons: not exactly tracking the \"main brand\" indices so future performance may vary. Just launched (2024), low volume and shorter track record. Note: EUR, not in USD according to what I found. So idk how it might work with IBKR, I assume no change but im not 100% sure. fwra: Pros: VWRA but cheaper + instead of Vanguard, its invesco. Cons: low volume, relatively new as well. vwra: Pros: high liquidity, broader than ACWD in terms of \"coverage\", vanguard is a giant and staple company for investments. Cons: higher TER, no exposure to small caps. acwd Pros: lower cost than VWRA and still covers decent coverage. Cons: not as much coverage as VWRA. lower volume. imid Pros: has large; medium; and small caps. Similar TER than the rest given the \"coverage\" in markets. Cons: low volume, sampling risk (they dont buy ALL the stocks but a sample instead), and exposure to small caps means higher volatility. IMID might be worth to look to get \"everything\" but if you want cost efficiency for similar coverage to vwra, ACWD / WEBN might be good.

If you want more small cap exposure there's some offerings by DFA(Dimensional Fund Advisors), but you really should understand that its an actively managed ETF that's not just market cap weighted ETF. Therefore the TER for DFA is higher. DFA to me is super interesting, but you have to know they haven't beat the market in the last few years because the large cap US stocks have performed so well in the last few cycles. By the way that they do their fund, it will increase the exposure to small cap stocks, value stocks. They also recently launched Irish docimiled ETFs. They actively use finance research, and their funds are designed to beat the market, which prior to the tech rally, they do beat vanguard's funds and sometimes do beat the market. I am not paid in anyway by those funds or youtube videos, just like you are curious what others think. I'm personally leaning to SWRD+EIMI just for the time being as DFA irish funds are super new aka low liquidity. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfknibBat2A https://www.dimensional.com/us-en/etfs",

Heard that ACWD is the closest to VWRA amongst the others, as they track close to 3000 entities whilst VWRA is around 4000+. Taking into account that ACWD already tracks so many entities, thus the fact that they are only 0.12 in TER compared to VWRA probably means over the long-term they should have a higher returns of achieving better returns? Just curious, if you guys have any ETFs to recommend other than VWRA where I feel that the 0.19 TER will eat into my profits over the long run.

If mainstream FI are finally recommending gold, it’s going to get crowded. But to hedge against currency debasement you’ll need gold. Holding just equities is not enough. Because there is a regime change. Understand what the US is trying to do. The US debt  and the interest on their debt is unsustainable. They need to lower interest rates. The fed can cut rates but that will only influence rates on the short end of the bond yield. They can’t control the long end. One idea that’s been floated is to allow the USD to devalue. But devalue against what?  They can allow it to devalue against gold. At the US treasury, gold has a statutory price of $42+. This was set in the 1970s and they have not revalued this. What treasury could do is to revalue gold, mark it to market and suddenly the treasury has “free” money, which they can sell to the Fed. Fed prints the dollars. This is just accounting to give the US treasury new “money”. In addition to this, the Genius act which allow private companies to issue stable coins that are backed by treasuries is a natural buyer of short duration bonds and bills. This helps keep the short term borrowing cost down. But the clarity act allows these stables coins to generate yield. companies like Tether are taking these yields and buying gold. Tether has one of the largest non-nation entity holding gold. Guess what the US government could do? They could ask Tether to back (buy) US long duration treasuries with their gold thus making US treasuries gold-backed. This would massively devalue the US currency but allow them to control yield at the long end, meaning they can borrow at a lower rate. In the end bond holders suffer and a massive transfer of purchasing power go to holders to gold Central banks were already sniffing this eventuality out years ago. Even Singapore has started increasing our gold reserves. 100% equity is not it anymore. That worked well 25-30 years ago. The regime has changed. How you invest must also adapt.",

According to the modern portfolio theory, investors are compensated with higher expected returns only by taking on additional systematic risk. However, this total portfolio risk can be optimised by adding uncorrelated asset classes. This allows an investor to reduce overall volatility without necessarily sacrificing the portfolio's expected return. Historically, gold has maintained very low correlation to equities (between 0 to 0.3). This means that gold's price movement is largely independent of the stock market. This improved stability results in better sharpe ratio, signifying higher return per unit of risk taken. In terms of portfolio rebalancing, having a predetermined allocation also allows you to invest in the \"cheaper\" asset. For example, my target allocation for gold in my portfolio is 10%. As of the most recent price movement, my gold allocation has surged to 11%. This allows me to avoid putting more money into gold (since it is overweight and \"expensive\") and channel my incoming funds into the relatively \"cheaper\" equities instead.",

I'm helping her manage it because she's not investment-savvy.\n\nthe problem is she's extremely 'old school', meaning she's terrified of capital loss, so zero interest in crypto or anything that fluctuates. Her only goal is to preserve the principal while getting 2-3% just to beat inflation a bit. I know the usual suspects are SSBs and T-bills, but we hit the $200k cap and T-Bills are abit of a hassle to keep rolling for this amount.\n\nAny ideas on where to park the remaining $1.3M? Are money market funds safe enough for a retiree's life savings? Or should I stick to laddering fixed deposits across different banks.\n\nWould appreciate any advice from anyone who has managed a similar situation for their parents!",
