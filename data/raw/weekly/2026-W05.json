The rooftops is where I proposed. Today, you created another core memory for me.\n\nI got the idea when the team started setting up the stage and Linkin Park was played on the speakers at the Amphitheatre. I thought how great it will be to hear Trivium's riffs played right there now. I followed them since the start and even saw them play in Barcelona during my honeymoon. After some moments, I decided to do it and went up to the Front of House to ask if you could play some Trivium. You knew the band. Without even a moment of hesitation, you said you could play 1 song and asked what song I wanted. In Waves was decided.\n\nThank you for agreeing to my request between your soundchecks, even delaying it a few minutes to allow the song to finish. That song being the last before soundchecks for the drums resumed. It was a surreal moment hearing heavy metal being blasted through the speakers while looking at the city line, MBS and the waterfront. It was a moment of pure catharsis for me. The absurdity of metal being played at such a venue, that moment of control over a public space. It created a core memory for me, one that I will now relive whenever I play that song on my headphones.\n\nThank you for giving me this.\n\n\"Even in the darkest moments, the happy memories will light the way\".\n\nUPDATE: The sound tech has been found and this post has been shared with him",

The bosses are literally hypocrites at work, say support the team but at the same time makan so much of your commission. When help is needed, those “seniors” or “leaders” will asked “what do you think?” instead of solving the issue. Promotions are also based on how close you are with the upp management, not by meritocracy. The most poor thing are those in the media team, worked OT, pay so little and kena squeeze dry. Overall the PLB painted a fake beautiful persona to the social media, really an organisation just full of shit.",

Obviously after you ask, the idea is to guide them along the right path, a tailored solution that is either something they can already do but need the direction alignment wih company's SOP, or something they might need to challenge themselves on, to adjust the way they react to the issue. But it's been abused by incompetent management to deflect and taichi all responsibility away from their higher position. The whole point of being in a higher position means your head chop first, so if you also don't know, then why your head so high lmao. Really smh sometimes.

      "selftext": "SINGAPORE – Senior management at a software company wanted to remove the head of a sales team from his role after he sent aggressive e-mails attacking another team leader and refused to apologise to her.\n\nBut SAP Asia decided to place Mr Prashant Mudgal on a 45-day performance improvement plan (PIP) before terminating his employment in 2019.\n\nThis decision was described as a “farce” by a High Court judge, who said the company had prejudged him and did not give him a genuine opportunity to improve.\n\nMr Mudgal, a foreign national, sued his former employer for nearly $5 million in loss of earnings from 2020 until May 31, 2025.\n\nOn Jan 21, Justice Dedar Singh Gill awarded him $1,000 in nominal damages, rejecting his contention that the company’s conduct caused him to suffer “crippling” financial losses.\n\nIn his written judgment, he recognised the implied term of mutual trust and confidence.\n\nIt is a rule in English common law that requires both employer and employee to act in a way that does not destroy or seriously damage the mutual trust and confidence between them.\n\nThe judge said SAP breached the term by behaving in an “intolerable or wholly unacceptable” way because it placed Mr Mudgal on the PIP even though it had the endgame of terminating his employment in mind.\n\n“In so doing, the defendant had prejudged the claimant and misled him into thinking that he was being given a genuine opportunity to improve his conduct and/or performance when this was not the case,” he added.\n\nJustice Gill noted that SAP had an “easy means” of dealing with Mr Mudgal by invoking the termination clause in the employment agreement.\n\n“Yet, this was not the remedy that the defendant immediately availed itself to. It imposed a farce of the PIP on the claimant,” he said.\n\nThe company is the Singapore-incorporated subsidiary of a German multinational corporation that develops software systems to manage business operations.\n\nMr Mudgal was head of services sales in the Asia-Pacific and Japan region for a line of cloud-based management software. He had a strained relationship with Ms Otsakchon Raman, head of services delivery for the same line of business in the Asia-Pacific and Japan and Greater China regions.\n\nThe events leading up to his termination centred on two incidents.\n\nOne incident in July 2018 arose from the transfer of a staff member, who was working on an ongoing project in India, from Ms Raman’s team to Mr Mudgal’s team.\n\nA series of e-mail exchanges between Ms Raman and a member of Mr Mudgal’s team led him to send an abrasive e-mail to Ms Raman, accusing her team of “gross incompetence”.\n\nAnother dispute in October 2018 over project timelines led Mr Mudgal to send an e-mail, with senior management copied, in which he attacked Ms Raman’s leadership and integrity.\n\nHe refused to apologise when asked to do so.\n\nIn November 2018, Ms Charmaine Seabury, the global vice-president of services sales, told human resources business partner Adele Teo-Gomez that there was “full alignment” among senior leaders on removing Mr Mudgal.\n\nOver a month, Ms Teo-Gomez and others from the employee relations department discussed the various options with Ms Seabury.\n\nMr Mudgal was formally placed on the PIP between March 21 and May 5 in 2019.\n\nOn Oct 25, 2019, Ms Seabury made it known that she wanted his employment to be terminated “as soon as possible”, saying that there were still issues with his conduct.\n\nThe notice of termination was served on Mr Mudgal on Nov 21. It stated that he would be placed on garden leave and that his last day would be Dec 31.\n\nThe judge said the evidence made it clear that Mr Mudgal was prejudged, pointing to the e-mails sent among various individuals including Ms Seabury, Ms Teo-Gomez and Ms Raman.\n\nPrior to Mr Mudgal being placed on the PIP, there were individuals within the management who were adamant about removing him from the company’s employment as soon as possible, he noted.\n\nJustice Gill said Mr Mudgal was never given a genuine opportunity to improve. “The attitude which Ms Seabury bore towards the claimant, namely her desire to terminate his employment as soon as possible, persisted even after she formally placed him on the PIP,” he added.\n\nHe noted that barely one month into the PIP, Ms Seabury told Ms Teo-Gomez that “we do not believe these changes in behaviour will be maintained” and that “we would like to remove him from the business as soon as possible”.\n\nThe judge added, however, that Mr Mudgal failed to show that his loss of future earnings flowed from the company’s conduct.\n\nMr Mudgal arrived at the figure of nearly $5 million by applying a “conservative” 10 per cent uplift to his annual future earnings from his last-drawn annual income of $665,673 in 2019, less his earnings to-date of $50,000. He claimed he has been unable to find employment despite applying for more than 300 jobs from 2020 to 2023.\n\nJustice Gill said: “I fail to see how (SAP’s) conduct would have had any bearing on (Mr Mudgal’s) employability in the labour market, much less caused him ‘irreparable damage to his ability to secure gainful employment’.”\n\nHe added that it was objectively easy to see how and why Mr Mudgal’s “self-righteous and unyielding behaviour” contributed to the hostility in an already volatile environment between the two teams.\n\n“He was, to a large extent, the author of his own misfortunes that culminated in the termination of his employment,” said Justice Gill.\n\n“The outcome of this case may well be a Pyrrhic victory for the claimant, but I hope that it will provide him with some vindication and allow him to move on with his life.”\n\nThe judge said the facts of this case showed why the implied term of mutual trust and confidence is needed. “There is nothing irreconcilable between the right to bring an employment relationship to an end and the duty not to behave in an intolerable or wholly unacceptable way,” he said.\n\nhttps://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/ex-employee-who-sued-software-firm-sap-for-5m-over-termination-gets-1000-in-pyrrhic-victory",

This means lots of t-shirts. When Singaporeans holiday overseas, we don't have a lot of cold weather wear, and to save money, we often buy 1 big down jacket and/or buy as few garments as possible that can be used in the widest range of temperatures. This also means we often end up looking a little off-season. Big puffy down jackets in autumn, wearing t-shirts underneath the overcoat, layering like mad to make up for a lack of a good sweater or what. As opposed to local people who have garments that are suited/styled precisely to that weather, so when put next to locals who are very appropriately and fashionably dressed to that weather, we kind of stick out a little. Even in summer, foreigners don't just chiong tshirts/singlets and shorts. Some of the non-tropical countries opt for more sun protection rather than just wearing as little as possible. Cotton shirt over t-shirt, etc.",

I have been working overtime every alternate days and wanted to use my weekends resting and playing games . My mum straight up refuses to allow me to play my games, which i barely have time to even do that during weekdays. She expected me to work even during weekends to save money. She will said this is for my own good and i should grow up and not play games and i don't need to rest that much.\n\nAs i do not agree with her terms, i said so and she said just because i have a work now, i'm bold now and want to be rude to her. I literally just started working and i don't even have my pay yet and my mom is simply accusing me of this things when im just trying to stand out for myself. To make the situation worse, she called my older brother to solve the issue, just for her to twist her words as to why we're arguing. At the end of the day, she crashed out at my brother and accused him of things he didn't even do such as trying to defend me, just like how she accuses me of things i never did. My mom is the kind of person to accuse/ assume things without any proofs.\n\nNow, im currently staying over at my brother's home but i do not intend to stay here for a long time. I do not have any emergency savings (this is purely my fault, i should've save) so i do not know what should i do moving foward. Just earlier when i woke up, my mom sent two voice messages, saying that no matter how evil she is, she is my mom and said who am i to talk back. I felt even more frustrated as how could she, as a grown adult and a mother of 4 said that to me as if what she said was valid.\n\nI do not know what to do now, but what i do know is i do not intent to listen to her and not able to spend my free time simply playing games, not going out partying or doing nonsense stuff etc. I wish i have life savings to rent a place but now i'm just stuck.\n\nJust fyi, before getting kicked out and stuff, i have been running away from house and staying in camp to escape the toxicity 2 different times",

I was youngest when I join them, half of them are in engineering school and the rest are in medical/dentistry. Only a couple of us are IT guys and we were the only guy with computer. My house mates are so poor, their whole wardrobe can fit in a duffle bag. We all chip-in for house meal, which was basically rice + vege + cheap protein (mostly eggs). For me that was the first time to witness the real-life struggle. I moved in with a PC and two large luggage, I was the rich kid there. I remember one incident, when one of my roommate (Dentist) was graduating and he don't have anything nice to wear for ceremony. He don't want to buy new clothes just for that. I have to insist him to wear my clothes. During my stay there (4~5 years) I don't buy any new clothes because I felt like I have too many things compare to them. They were the one extracted my first wisdom tooth for free. My teachers gave me some side projects (IT related) to do part-time/contract so I can earn money and experience. A bit of tutoring here and there. Sometime help larger team to do their system implementation, assembling computers, on site users support (over night) during year end closing/inventory stock taking, data migration. Also prepare medical/engineering project/term paper documentation for submission for my house-mates, at first for free but they gave me pocket money. Later they connected me to their class mates (so I can earn money). After I moved out of that place, I worked in a restaurant for 7~8 months to clear my head. It was physically exhausting (F&B) but also my head was super clear, every night slept like a log. Money was solid because accommodation and all meals/drinks are provided, even for the off day. And no free-time or energy to spend money except play LAN game (CS) for a couple of hours. As long as you realized that you need money and have to work .. then you will find lots of work (might be bad/lousy/tiring or even dangerous) but still you will find them.

Like what others have suggested, maybe start by gaining their trust and building confidence? Group travels, solo travel in shorter capacities before a 10-day japan solo trip. Yes Japan it’s safe but it’s a 6h+/- flight from Singapore and if anything happen you won’t be easily reached. Hope you can put urself in their shoes even if their words are on the harsher side.

Why aren't they already convinced of your capabilities, and what could you do to change that? You can't just ask for stuff and expect things to be approved automatically.

I could def handle myself as I went on an immersion trip in poly and after school activities, I was the one who led my team to travel around Shanghai. Look... \"staying out till late\" and \"going on a solo trip\",are not the same thing. They are definitely \"quite different\". That said, I think your other trips are much more relevant, so focus on those. Consider the differences in those experiences:\n1. Length - were the other trips also of similar length? Every extra day is extra planning to be done.\n2. Destination - are those countries particularly safer? Or, nearer/easier to get to? What are the people typically like? \n3. Activities - did the trips revolve around city areas, or was there often terrain / environmental danger involved? \n4. Emergency plan - in the event of emergency, what's the plan? Who can you call, and who can your parents call? If there's a good difference in any of these questions, then that's probably what they're focused on. Otherwise, if your previous trips are very similar, you can try to drill down on what exactly is it that gives them so much pause. So that’s why I was disappointed that they didn’t trust me enough. It's often not you. As any driver will tell you, the biggest hazard on the road is \"other drivers\". The best driver in the world can still get into an accident as long as there's one other reckless person. They may not doubt your skill and independence, but rather the things/people that you are exposing yourself to. But again, although I think that it's bullshit to make such a big threat out of \"love\", the fact is that people won't always say what they mean, and strangers will be even worse to tourists.",

I love my work, but it's getting to a point I'm starting to question my sanity and my physical health.\n\nI work 10 hours everyday, longer if there's meetings or a lot of paperwork to clear. Often, I clear paperwork on the weekends as well. My only reprieve is aiming to sleep 8 hours every day and occasionally spending time with my friends/partner.  Wake up, work, after work eat, come back sleep. No time for much else.\n\nI'm worried about burnout, both physically and mentally but can't quit because this is the best paying job in my field for a degree and I'm not remotely ready to do a Masters. Not to mention bond. I also don't want to burnout as it'll affect the quality of my work, something I cannot (afford to) compromise on.\n\nThe job gives me satisfaction and I leave everyday fulfilled, but dead tired and frustrated as I can't exactly enjoy my hobbies of gaming as weekends are often burnt planning for the week ahead or catching up on paperwork. I don't have time to exercise unless I cut gaming completely, which I don't exactly want to either.\n\nI know this sounds like a \"woe is me\" post but I'm not sure how better to cope. I'm slow af in my job and already am pacing it out so I can breathe while clearing as much shit as possible but it's just too much. I'm learning strategies from my colleagues but I feel it's a \"me\" thing to struggle. Definitely not ready for a family at this point.\n\nEdit: Doesn't help my parents glorify slaving, claiming they work everyday too. My aunt works till 1/2am sometimes and wakes up at 5, my mom is permanently on her laptop rotating between work and YouTube everyday of the week. They also shared that I chose this job and it's \"life\". My partner is just as frustrated to the point the response is usually \"haiz... What can we do?\" Or \"well...\"\n\nEdit Edit: Genuinely appreciate all of the comments thus far. I really can't quit due to bond, and as mentioned in my comment, I'm only earning 4.5k which is not a lot (I'm already beating myself up earning this little at 30), while industry average (GOD BLESS) is 3k or lesser, with many of my former classmates struggling greatly to find work as it is saturated. My only option is to pia for part-time Masters with lesser sleep as I can't take NPL or Sabbatical but I can't afford that either.

      "selftext": "Visited recently. Almost instantly it became starkly apperant to me how damn clean Singapore is. Not only that but the overall vibe felt insanely relaxed compared to what I'm used to. Way less honking, if any honking, drivers using turn signals and not flying all over the place, pedestrians were more respectful of each other and people seemed friendlier and less aggressive. In Chicago it's normal for people to use their horn to communicate pretty much anything. Even if they're just annoyed to be sitting in traffic they sometimes will lay on their horn to express that. Or if one person holds up other drivers, seemingly everyone behind them will lay on their horn, and oftentimes yell at them when going past. Also, I heard some people say Singapore is really dense, so I expected it to feel dense. But it didn't feel that dense to me at all. If anything it felt very spacious, green and like you had tons of breathing room everywhere.\n\nThe most recent US city I lived in was Chicago, and compared to Singapore, Chicago feels massive and everything is way closer together. Chicago feels about 4-5x bigger and denser than Singapore in just about every way, and like there's much less room to breathe. So, how does Singapore achieve this? I thought it was lovely.\n\nI'm used to things being this close together everywhere outside of downtown\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/skyscrapers/comments/1icnhl6/chicago_aerial_view/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button",

I think a big difference is that the density peaks far higher in the US. There is a very dense downtown core with almost no residents that quickly spreads out into suburban sprawl. In Singapore, the business and commercial districts are less dense, which makes the densest areas feel more spacious, and conversely there isn't suburban sprawl, so even the most spread out areas feel comparable to or a little denser than an inner suburb like Evanston. It's also in part because Singapore operates more like what one might consider to be far bigger cities, like NYC, in that there are secondary business and commercial districts. I don't know Chicago specifically that well here, but in general in the US I'm used to needing to go downtown a lot. Singaporeans generally don't go to the CBD except to work because things are somewhat spread out around the island into a few other clusters as well. This is somewhat deliberate, as many \"towns\" in Singapore are designed to be somewhat self-contained for daily living. Having trees and parks also goes a long way. This is deliberate policy, without which much of the green space would be \"optimised away\", and everything would feel far denser.",

The debt repayment scheme allows you to manage the debt but musn't be more than 5 years. So, at best, it would be around $1,677 per month. That means he has to find a side gig or cut down on his expenses. I would personally  go with option 3... Rather bite the bullet than suffer the pain and uncertainty in the long run. You don't know if the car breaks down and how much the repairs would be in the next 10 years or so.

He might even elevate the party because the party is racially Chinese while the Vatican is of the west. The transition from GCT to LHL nearly got Sg this guy. The transition from LHL to LW took a decade and resulted in the PAP’s 3rd choice. I wonder if any of the old fogeys will spill the tea on how GCT really got selected… I think that these events strongly underline the need for a strong opposition. GY still has significant favourability in the PAP. They needed the help of the opposition to purge him and his faction.

Last week, I had been called in for a performance review to be put on PIP.\n\nGranted I am not a stellar performer, but I do my job diligently and try my best. In the first year, I think I was not performing up to standard according to my boss and was asked what are the reasons. I explained that I think there is a job mismatch but I will try my best to learn. However, I find the directions given to me very vague and a lot of times, I just could not nail it. My boss also mentioned that when she hired me, she thought that I am well-versed in handling media. However, I mostly did events  where some were quite high profile and were covered by medias. I guess it is on me that I thought that those were the same as media engagement.\n\nAfter 6 months, I realised that the scope of work is totally off and anything I proposed were just getting shot down. After that, I lost confidence and kept a low profile. I began doing menial tasks, get heavily involved in other department's work. after 1.5 years, I really just cant seem to get the grip of things.\n\nThat said, my bosses were not great, in fact, the entire department were complaining and looking for other job themselves. Naturally, I started the same and was lucky that I scored some interviews. Recently, I have a few second round interviews with other ministries/agencies, and am waiting for official offer.\n\nHowever, last week's performance review came, and they say that my grading will be recorded and it would be shared throughout the entire government record. They indirectly advise me to leave asap but I was adamant to stay for the bonus. We ended with that I will resign when I qualify for my bonus, which when she said to me that my \"bad\" grading would be included and stay in government records forever, and I better secure the offer before its being included as it would affect my future opportunities.\n\nAlso, not to play the blame game, my bosses are getting absolutely pummeled by the senior management team. Our senior management also commented that the middle management (my bosses) are not up to standard, which further validates my view that as much as I am not up to standard, they cannot just pin all the blames on me alone...\n\nLet say in worse case scenario, I get Ds/Es, how screwed am I? Also, I am afraid that once the PRP sets in, HR would inform my potential new hiring agency/ministry that I am currently on PRP and drop me after HR checks... thanks in advance!\n\n*Edit: My bosses also claimed to have provided email coaching, which for the record, I do not receive much. There is not even face to face consultation. When she asked for a piece of work, I would complete it, check through with my colleague (who is supposedly the best performer) and get her green light. But she will come back with not good enough etc. I have recorded and documented our last 3 months email exchanges and I am quite sure not one is a 'coaching' email... Heck, what is 'receiving coaching through emails' anyway???",

Today my pay is much much higher and I am very valued in the current company - the old place? Still doing things the same old way. Took me only a year+ to figure out the misfit and take action to correct it. Anyone who complains about their bosses and takes no action themselves, have only themselves to blame. If one is truly good, you will find your value somewhere, or, find what is valued and learn it to be of value to others. Also based on your actions, hiding elsewhere, doing menial tasks, doing (unrecognised) work for other departments, you have yet to learn needed basic workplace skills. Your bosses are mediocre but you have your ownself to blame for much of the current predicament.",

Here's how can fix this though. The trick to making friends is three things. 1. Showing up at the same place again and again where you meet someone. (Can even be league of legends) 2. Asking them questions and doing their activity and seeing if they reciprocate. 3. Being vulnerable, showing your true self, and telling them something sensitive. Make plans and initiate, and keep repeating until something forms. it is a numbers game. I am an ambiverted person but even for me it's very difficult to socialise in Singapore. For eg I made the same number of friends I have in Singapore in Malaysia in 5 days. That's how conserved we are. Do not care if they are men or women or anything accept them and be respectful and try to have fun with them. People love when you allow space for them to exist in your world and then shown your world. Not the other way around. You have already made one step of being vulnerable about this, if i can help would love that :)",

The SC must be at least 21 years old, and the non-citizen family member must hold a valid Long Term Visit Pass (LTVP) or Work Pass.\n\nHence, our dear foreign scholar friends who enjoys a fully sponsored education from secondary school all the way through university and now became a new citizen can simply use one of their non citizen parents’ name to purchase a HDB.\n\nIf you are wondering why your new citizen uni mate already owns a hdb and can always host hot pot parties, this is the reason why 😄",

      "selftext": "I’m a 30-year-old Malay Singaporean, and I’ve been reflecting a lot on what true equality might look like in our society. This isn’t a rant or an attack — it’s based on patterns I’ve noticed in everyday life, especially around language, inclusion, and social expectations. My true intention is to bring forth a Singapore that would be as close to the ideal that we preach about in our songs and anthems.\n\nI would like to start this off by saying that racism in Singapore exists. While this may be clear to many of us, the systemic and subliminal factors often fly below the radar.\n\nI would also like to place a disclaimer that while this post may criticise the majority race, I truly believe that most Chinese Singaporeans have no intent to be racist and truly desire the meritocracy that Singapore prides itself on but may lack the perspective of how certain actions/speech patterns may come across to minorities.\n\n1. Gatekeeping of the Chinese language\n\nOften times, you would hear Malay words being completely butchered but tolerated by the Malay community.\n\nTerbalik → Tombalik\n\nAgak agak → Agar agar\n\nHalal → Halah\n\nThese are just some of the many Malay words often mispronounced but tolerated as we still understand the intent being sent across. However, the opposite is often untrue in Singaporean society. A person from a minority race attempting to speak Chinese is often chastised for being unclear and very often, corrected in a strict manner in terms of intonation (often in an impatient and ridiculing manner, especially from the older generation).\n\nWhile I do understand most Chinese people are brought up with this culture of correcting speech, as the language and intent of the vocabulary often changes drastically with minor differences in intonation, this creates a barrier that stops other races from picking up the language.\n\nMinority Chinese speakers are often either taught from young, naturally linguistically talented, or have had to take formal classes in order to achieve a proficiency in which they are not corrected by native Chinese speakers.\n\nAnother point to add would be the drastic difference in attitude towards Westerners attempting Chinese, who are often highly praised despite mispronouncing the language. While I do understand that this is merely a facade shown and often ridiculed behind the Westerner’s back, it still creates encouragement for the Westerner to continue attempting to learn the language.\n\nThis contrast would be something I’d like the Chinese Singaporean community to consider whenever a minority race attempts the language. Ideally, imitating Japanese culture could potentially be very worthwhile. The two languages hold similarity linguistically, but the Japanese are often extremely accepting of any attempts on the language, to the point of showering the speaker with compliments despite mispronouncing the language.\n\nThis significantly encourages minority speakers to pick up the language if they’re willing and creates less segregation in our multi-racial country.\n\n2. Chinese-speaking preferred job listings\n\nYes, I understand that the average Chinese Singaporean has no power in this department. However, I’d like to highlight how listings like this further segregate our country.\n\nInitially, job listings like these were targeted for roles involving sales, which would be reasonable to a certain extent, as the majority of the older Chinese population may not be as proficient in English.\n\nHowever, recently there has been a surge in job listings like these in SME roles in marketing, warehouses, tech, and many others. I understand that this is a byproduct of capitalism (China workers who are unable to speak English well often dominate these workspaces), but I’d like to highlight the segregated environment it creates. Workplaces like these are often devoid of minorities and create a sense of lost opportunity for the minorities. While the racism may not be intentional as it is driven by capitalism, the effect it has on minorities is significant. This creates a systemic divide between races and could spiral out of hand, especially in the current job market.\n\nWhile the average Singaporean is unable to make an impact on factors like these, I would still like to share my opinion and point this out in hopes that it may reach the eyes of someone with the power to make a step towards change.\n\n3. The rise of Chinese-dominated social spaces\n\nFrom what I’ve personally noticed in recent years, common heartland eateries such as Kopitiams, bakeries, and smaller supermarket brands have increasingly begun hiring China workers who speak little to no English. As a result, minority races may feel less inclined to be patrons of these establishments. As you may have noticed in heartland areas (Tampines from personal experience), there is an increase in segregation even within these previously common areas for different races. Kopitiams with almost exclusively Chinese clientele and Malay-Muslim eateries such as Al-Makan having almost exclusively minority clientele. With Chinese-dominated social spaces being the majority in most heartland areas.\n\nThe most common argument for this point would be the lack of Halal-certified options in kopitiams. While this may be true to a certain extent, most kopitiams often have 1–2 Halal stores within the establishment, though the number of minority customers has decreased significantly. The rise of monolingual China workers only creates a further divide in this fragile ecosystem — unofficially and silently creating the very segregated spaces that we were warned about in our social studies textbooks.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis post is meant to inform everyone about some of the numerous struggles that a minority would face in Singapore. I do not seek to cause further discourse and segregation within our country and would highly encourage the vocal minority to avoid adding to the already heated discourse that’s ubiquitous online. I believe the majority of the Chinese population do not intend on deliberately widening the gap between us and genuinely seek harmonious relationships with one another. I’m just hoping to spread a little more empathy amongst one another and seek true meritocracy and racial equality in this little island that we reside in.\n\nIf you’ve made this far, I wholeheartedly am grateful for listening to this little rant of mine. I’m also curious if other minority Singaporeans have noticed similar patterns, and how we might encourage more inclusive social and work environments. Thank you for taking the time to read my little Roman Empire.\n\n- a 30-year-old Malay-Filipino minority born in the Little Red Dot",

And it'll feel like the below image...\n\nMe yelling into the void that is the internet and this sub.\n\nBut before you set a goal to \"fire your boss\" in 3 years or dump your savings into the market hoping for a miracle, I want to say \"Investments won't make you rich (probably)\".\n\nThere is a lot of noise on social media (tiktok and youtube) selling the idea that the stock market is a \"get rich quick\" vehicle. Most veterans in this sub area already familiar with this fact.\n\nBUT I want to argue a slightly unpopular point,Passive invest-ing (index funds) will strictly NOT make you rich.However, it is the most reliable way to secure a modest, comfortable retirement.\n\nThis is geared towards the new people...\n\nMy friend, it's not about being a billionaire. It's about havingenough. This amount is unique to everyone and is definitely achievable for everyone, given that they follow these simple steps:\n\nSecure your short term goals first in safer-assets.\n\nDon't excessively spend and start saving & invest-ing. Any amount is sufficient, but for you to reach your goal quicker, it's in your best interest to save more. (But of course to enjoy life, its up to you to find that balance).\n\nInvest in a well-diversified, broad-based low-cost index fund. (Sub's favorites are VWRA and CSPX).\n\nStay invested.\n\nFirst, we have to define terms. When most people say they want to be \"Rich,\" they mean being able to flex the purchase of a Lamborghini, quitting their job in 5 years, or flashing a Rolex.\n\nWhen we talk about a \"Modest Retirement\" or being \"Wealthy,\" we mean financially independent. The ability to maintain your standard of living without working, usually achieved over decades.\n\nIndex funds are a tool for the latter, not the former. If your goal is a yacht by 30, index funds are mathematically thewrongtool for you.\n\nInvest-ing is amultiplier, not agenerator.\n\nMany people obsess over \"beating the market\" to get an extra 1% return, while ignoring that their principal investment is too small to matter.\n\nYou cannot index-fund your way out of a low income (or a low savings rate). To get to that modest retirement, you must focus on your \"Shovel\" (your active income/career) to fuel the engine. The savings rate matters infinitely more than the rate of return for the first decade of your journey.\n\nTo illustrate this, assume we have 2 people, one person who invests $500 a month @ 8% p.a. and another person who invests $200 a month @ 20% p.a.\n\nWho do you think has a higher portfolio value at the end of 10 years?\n\nSavings rate matters alot.\n\nIf you guessed $500 a month at 8% p.a., that is right! Yes, from the graph, you can see that given a couple more years the 20% p.a. guy is going to overtake the 8% p.a. guy. But that requires someone to average 20% p.a. for more than 10 years.\n\nYou literally need to be Warren Buffett to emulate this.\n\nLet's look at the actual numbers. Let's say you have$10,000to invest and the market returns a historical average of8%. (I know it's higher than the conservative estimateI always use of 6%, but it helps getting the point across okay. SHHH)\n\n30+ years is a long time. It’s a career. That is the definition of a \"modest retirement.\" It is slow and boring... (It also doesn't help that most of us think that$1M might not be enough).\n\nIf you're curious how long it'll take to reach $1,000,000 based on a 8% p.a. return and xxx contribution...\n\nIt really does plateau after a while...\n\nIf you're curious as to how this graph looks like if you're assuming an even moreconservativereturn of5.5% p.a.(maybe due to SGD strengthening against USD or you have a more diversified portfolio and you're trading returns for significantly reduced volatility...)\n\nThe same trend appears where it looks like it sorts of plateau after a while...\n\nJust for funsies (and[censored]and giggles). What if you want to be \"Rich\" quickly? What if you want that same $10,000 to turn into $1 million in just10 yearswithout adding extra monthly contributions?\n\nTo achieve this, you would need an Annualized Rate of Return (CAGR) of~58.5%.\n\nThis is almostimpossible, the data I get areall from here(setting the years to be the last 100 years):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/btoi0d2ljafg1.png?width=873&format=png&auto=webp&s=da28dab35ebe4f5b9c1ee515c37b11c449fddb90\n\nTo chase a 58% annual return long term, you physicallyCANNOTuse index funds. You are forced into high-risk vehicles:0DTE options, leveraged crypto,orpicking penny stocks.And we know how well that turns out for some people over at a certain WSB subreddit. (if the /s is not conveyed properly, this is a VERY bad idea...)\n\nMathematically, attempting to get \"Rich\" quickly forces you into a risk bracket where you are statistically likely to go to $0. Accepting \"modest\" returns is the only thing that protects you from total ruin.\n\nAccording to data from theSpectrem Group (and similar wealth surveys), most deca-millionaires(and similar wealth surveys), most deca-millionaires(it's a plain bagel video I know, but he breaks it down pretty well here) did not get there by getting lucky on a single stock pick or crypto coin. They built wealth through:\n\nThe Money Guys also did a similar survey on their millionaire clients and point 1) also pops up.\n\nInvest-ing was simply the place theyparkedthe wealth they had already created to keep it safe and growing. It was not the source of the wealth creation itself.\n\nMy friend, it's not about being a deca-millionaire or even a billionaire. It's about havingenough. This amount is unique to everyone and is definitely achievable for everyone, given that they follow these simple steps:\n\nDisclaimer: I used AI to format this post, but the thoughts & graphs are all mine.

To the point that my first bank account was created because I needed one to credit my Edusave award, and promptly taken over by my parents for daily necessities. All along, my parents told me never to touch stocks. Investment was a taboo word. Apparently, before they had me, my parents burnt more than $100k. Till today, they refused to tell me what happened. Many folks have told me to invest. I know. But when I was in my 20s, I was scared. Scared of my hard earned monies evaporating. Just like my parents’. I didnt like asking around too. Because personal finance is personal - you ask people, you are going to receive tonnes of answers. Some obviously have an agenda (like … SIGN UP FOR MY MASTERCLASS TO LEARN HOW TO BE A WARREN BUFFET OVERNIGHT). Doesn’t help that the financial world is full of jargons - and from someone who consistently failed Economics, I badly needed an ELI5 for all these investment concepts. What is NAV? What are unrealised profits? What is NFT? Etc. And this subreddit is toxic. People flaunting off about 5 digit monthly salaries, multi-million portfolios or an almost-ascetic lifestyle. I remembered I dipped my toes into Syfe robo-investment in 2022, and when I saw my portfolio dip I cashed it out straightaway. Rookie mistake of emotional investment. This year, I signed up for Moomoo and IBKR. And I have been actively investing since Nov 2025. Partly because I have hit my financial goals (savings) and I can aggressively start investing.

Thankful for the kind comments.\n\nNot clickbait, not selling a program/book or monetizing in any way. There aren’t a lot of posts about life after FIRE (vs. the many about attaining it), so hopefully this adds to the discourse.\n\nWhat this post is not about -Investment choices, FIRE amount, personal financial balance sheet. A lot of shifus here are better than me on those topics. These are relevant to FIRE but not to the specifics of life after FI that I will like to write about below.\n\nReflections 1: Fear of the “lottery” curse\n\nAttaining FIRE can feel like winning the lottery. The common myth I believed is that lottery winners experience a short term spike in happiness and then end up not much happier than non-winners in the longer term.\n\nReflections 2: Getting used to the main currency of time\n\nFIRE allows me to (mostly) ignore most day-to-day concerns of money. Without money vs. time conflicts, how I prioritise my time has turned out to be quite different\n\nReflections 3: What being free really means\n\nI hope this is helpful to those interested in FIRE.

It was super awkward cuz I can no longer fit into their conversations and the new faces (they joined the company only after I left the company) also made me feel I am an odd stranger out at their company party. After some time, we drifted apart and finally give up on talking totally. This happened after about 2yrs of struggling to find common things to talk about and I failed. For now, I have plenty to talk about with my current colleagues cuz we have the same job, the same customers, the same boss, etc. I would expect them to drift apart from me once I quit this company too. However, I am still in contact with my ex-classmates-friends from almost 30yrs ago. These friendships were not built on just conversations about work/customers/bosses. We were innocent children when we got to know each other and our conversations kept evolving as we went through different life stages after leaving school - about finding jobs, changing jobs, finding bf/gf, bgr problems, then spouses problems, our children, parents health, our own health, investments... and I have reached the age where we begin discussions on retirement plans and preparing ourselves mentally to say goodbyes to our aged and sick parents.",

Money market fund is very safe, but the returns are under 1.5% p.a. now so it won’t help you meet your goal of ~5% p.a. in “dividends”. And don’t get tricked into USD mmf with higher interest because the FX risk will just get you instead. Other products that I think could help you are 1) Allianz Income and Growth (can get thru Endowus for lower fees). This is about 1/3 US equities and 2/3 bonds, but the bonds are the riskier type and half perform more like equities. Read this for a more thorough explanation of pros and cons: https://investmentmoats.com/fund/allianz-income-growth-good-returns-for-past-3-years-sustain-7-income-yield/ 2) Amova Singapore Dividend Equity Fund (can’t  buy directly from Endowus, but you can buy from Poems or Dollardex then transfer to Endowus, and Endowus will let you buy more after that).  This is composed of Singapore stocks and gives out 5% p.a. dividends monthly while doing a pretty good job of maintaining or growing capital. A bit less bank-heavy than the Straits Times Index, and you pay higher fees but they solve the monthly payout problem for you. S-REITs also inside, so it’s good for “dummies”. People will probably tell you to invest in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for the lowest fees, but then you need to sell to create your “dividend”, and it requires more financial literacy. ETA: Your target is too high. But $6k per month from the full 1.5M being invested is possible.",

I'll share why the two funds (pimco gis income and allianz I&G) probably aren't the best rn Pimco gis income sells itself on two main factors: yield and large aum/prestige. Yield is high for all classes but is also because it doesn't take into account hedging cost. USDSGD hedging cost now, with how volatile the USD is, probably is >2% p.a., this will come out of your NAV. On yields, well lots of nations now are looking at USD in a different light, even if they do have more rate cuts it's likely the yields won't move much at all, hence it's duration position won't offer much upside. Long story short, NAV likely to erode, your 6% dividend net of fees and hedging cost, is typically closer to 3%, assuming spreads stay tight and yields are constant On AIG the dividend yield stated is not an organic yield. The organic yield of the fund is closer to 2+ 3%, due to its mix of HY bonds, convertibles and equities that are ALL US centric. Stated dividend yield 5+%, natural yield 2.5%, definitely will have erosion if bull run fades. All in all, not suitable for OP",

          "text": "I have been watching the precious metals market for a long time and have studied its history. Most people use the same framework they applied to traditional finance on precious metals. But the metals are different. They are as some would say, non-productive asset. It just sits there so you can’t value it the same way as you do for an equity. Most companies rise quickly in the beginning and the returns become slower over time. This makes intuitive sense. A small company can easily make returns of 100% to 1000% because it starts from a small base and its scaling up. But once it scales, markets saturate and returns normalises. But the metals, they are a different beast. Most of the returns come at the end of the run, not the beginning. The run has begun, at first slowly in Nov 2024, when gold finally broke out above $2000 and maintained momentum through 2025 and now we are witnessing an acceleration. The primary drivers are monetary in nature. The sovereign bonds have been weakening. The chaos and uncertainty of the Trump administration add fuel. Fo silver there have been 5- 6 consecutive years of supply deficit, meaning we are consuming more than the mines can produce each year and therefore we are depleting above ground stores. These are structural forces that won’t go away even with higher prices. But what precipitated the rise in the price of silver is also the fact that the gold to silver ratio at one point was above 100 in mid 2025. Meaning it takes more than 100 ounces of silver to buy an ounce of gold. Modern historical ratio sit around 40 to 60. Silver was super under valued compared to gold. When it’s so undervalued it attracted and incentivised demand  for silver. And the demand kept building. But what is different this time from the 2011 bull market is that the physical market is setting the price of silver, not the paper market. For years, London’s LBMA and COMEX were able to set the paper price of silver buy selling paper claims to silver which they may or may not have. But with the Shanghai metals exchange, where real physical metals are used to settle contracts instead of cash, they are pulling metals to the east. On Jan 1 2025 China has put up more restrictive measures on the export of silver. So right now if you look the price quoted on the LBMA/COMEX and the price quoted in Shanghai, there’s is almost a $10 difference. This is an arbitrage opportunity. But this opportunity did not close. It has persisted since 26 Dec 2025. This signals a tightness in the physical market and it’s not resolving. How high will this go? I don’t know but I do expect the price to stall or correct maybe at the 120 to 130 level because that’s when photovoltaic panel manufacturers start to become unprofitable at this price. The demand of silver will still be there. Maybe it will slow down enough for supply to catch up? But the monetary demand of silver will only continue to increase as uncertainty and bond prices continue to collapse. The primary driver of this move has not changed and I expect it to continue until confidence in the market is restored. But I don’t see that happening anytime soon.",

          "text": "This is based on historical precedence and market psychology within the commodities space. Here is an example with gold but you can look at this with silver, copper and lead. \nIn June 1971 gold was at $40/ounce and Nixon closed the gold redemption window in August. Then gold started to rise. It took about 2 years to rise to $100 in 1973. From there it bounced around $100-180 for 3 years until about August 1976. Then it started to move from 100 - 248 in 2 years (1978) and a sharp pull back down to $190. From here it more than tripled to $658 in less than 2 years. This was the acceleration. The rise of gold prices in the 70s was slow. It took 5 years to get past 200 and for the most part of these 5 years it was trading sideways. But it took less than 2 years to move from $200 to $650. If you were watching this happen in 1977, $650 would have seem to be an impossible number. But after this move gold traded sideways and down for 20 years. You can look at similar patterns for other commodities. For gold, it was a loss of confidence in the dollar in 1971 that precipitated its rise. But it took time for the general public to figure out what was really going on and when FOMO starts it can drive a retail frenzy. For silver, we are not quite there yet.  You may have seen reports of people overwhelming BullionStar or ppl in Australia queuing up at bullion dealers. But by and large the retail public is not really participating yet. What’s driving this right now is the physical industrial demand that accelerated at the end of last year. Perhaps some manufacturers, watching the price rise might have wanted to more inventory stock to ensure that they can continue to produce their EVs or photovoltaic panels. The Jan open interest on the COMEX is unusually high. The 3  margin hikes that the CME raised have failed to force the price down. I don’t know when this will end, but we have only just started. Crossing $100 is a milestone for silver. For silver, even at $100, it’s still below it inflated adjusted high of $50 in 1980. If it should repeat the same pattern on the same scale, it would be much higher considering the money supply today.",

Cons: not exactly tracking the \"main brand\" indices so future performance may vary. Just launched (2024), low volume and shorter track record. Note: EUR, not in USD according to what I found. So idk how it might work with IBKR, I assume no change but im not 100% sure. fwra: Pros: VWRA but cheaper + instead of Vanguard, its invesco. Cons: low volume, relatively new as well. vwra: Pros: high liquidity, broader than ACWD in terms of \"coverage\", vanguard is a giant and staple company for investments. Cons: higher TER, no exposure to small caps. acwd Pros: lower cost than VWRA and still covers decent coverage. Cons: not as much coverage as VWRA. lower volume. imid Pros: has large; medium; and small caps. Similar TER than the rest given the \"coverage\" in markets. Cons: low volume, sampling risk (they dont buy ALL the stocks but a sample instead), and exposure to small caps means higher volatility. IMID might be worth to look to get \"everything\" but if you want cost efficiency for similar coverage to vwra, ACWD / WEBN might be good.

Small caps from EIMI over time should add exposure and better fund performance in the long run, which should outperform ACWD's TER of 0.12% But its really marginal. If you want more small cap exposure there's some offerings by DFA(Dimensional Fund Advisors), but you really should understand that its an actively managed ETF that's not just market cap weighted ETF. Therefore the TER for DFA is higher. DFA to me is super interesting, but you have to know they haven't beat the market in the last few years because the large cap US stocks have performed so well in the last few cycles. By the way that they do their fund, it will increase the exposure to small cap stocks, value stocks. They also recently launched Irish docimiled ETFs. They actively use finance research, and their funds are designed to beat the market, which prior to the tech rally, they do beat vanguard's funds and sometimes do beat the market. I am not paid in anyway by those funds or youtube videos, just like you are curious what others think. I'm personally leaning to SWRD+EIMI just for the time being as DFA irish funds are super new aka low liquidity. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfknibBat2A https://www.dimensional.com/us-en/etfs",

Heard that ACWD is the closest to VWRA amongst the others, as they track close to 3000 entities whilst VWRA is around 4000+. Taking into account that ACWD already tracks so many entities, thus the fact that they are only 0.12 in TER compared to VWRA probably means over the long-term they should have a higher returns of achieving better returns? Just curious, if you guys have any ETFs to recommend other than VWRA where I feel that the 0.19 TER will eat into my profits over the long run.

Never be a sheep following the crowd (i.e. blindly get condo and/or car when it has little utility to you, and then later realise not worth it/expense prevented you from hitting FI earlier and changing your lifestlye in actual meaningful ways) Traps: - Got conned to invest in ILP (very early on when I was still naive).

My friend aged 64 recently used her 1.2mil cash savings to partially pay for her 27yr old daughter's new launch 2-bedder condo. Her daughter says new launch condo price will definitely go up a lot, more than resale flat price growth, so a new condo is a sure win investment. This elder is also someone who only trusted Fixed Deposits throughout her life... but now she trusts her daughter even more than Fixed Deposits.",

Without re-investment, the principal might draw down a bit because such funds prioritise the high monthly payouts for retirees.",
