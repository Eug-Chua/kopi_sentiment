The rooftops is where I proposed. Today, you created another core memory for me.\n\nI got the idea when the team started setting up the stage and Linkin Park was played on the speakers at the Amphitheatre. I thought how great it will be to hear Trivium's riffs played right there now. I followed them since the start and even saw them play in Barcelona during my honeymoon. After some moments, I decided to do it and went up to the Front of House to ask if you could play some Trivium. You knew the band. Without even a moment of hesitation, you said you could play 1 song and asked what song I wanted. In Waves was decided.\n\nThank you for agreeing to my request between your soundchecks, even delaying it a few minutes to allow the song to finish. That song being the last before soundchecks for the drums resumed. It was a surreal moment hearing heavy metal being blasted through the speakers while looking at the city line, MBS and the waterfront. It was a moment of pure catharsis for me. The absurdity of metal being played at such a venue, that moment of control over a public space. It created a core memory for me, one that I will now relive whenever I play that song on my headphones.\n\nThank you for giving me this.\n\n\"Even in the darkest moments, the happy memories will light the way\".\n\nUPDATE: The sound tech has been found and this post has been shared with him",

The bosses are literally hypocrites at work, say support the team but at the same time makan so much of your commission. When help is needed, those “seniors” or “leaders” will asked “what do you think?” instead of solving the issue. Promotions are also based on how close you are with the upp management, not by meritocracy. The most poor thing are those in the media team, worked OT, pay so little and kena squeeze dry. Overall the PLB painted a fake beautiful persona to the social media, really an organisation just full of shit.",

Obviously after you ask, the idea is to guide them along the right path, a tailored solution that is either something they can already do but need the direction alignment wih company's SOP, or something they might need to challenge themselves on, to adjust the way they react to the issue. But it's been abused by incompetent management to deflect and taichi all responsibility away from their higher position. The whole point of being in a higher position means your head chop first, so if you also don't know, then why your head so high lmao. Really smh sometimes.

      "selftext": "SINGAPORE – Senior management at a software company wanted to remove the head of a sales team from his role after he sent aggressive e-mails attacking another team leader and refused to apologise to her.\n\nBut SAP Asia decided to place Mr Prashant Mudgal on a 45-day performance improvement plan (PIP) before terminating his employment in 2019.\n\nThis decision was described as a “farce” by a High Court judge, who said the company had prejudged him and did not give him a genuine opportunity to improve.\n\nMr Mudgal, a foreign national, sued his former employer for nearly $5 million in loss of earnings from 2020 until May 31, 2025.\n\nOn Jan 21, Justice Dedar Singh Gill awarded him $1,000 in nominal damages, rejecting his contention that the company’s conduct caused him to suffer “crippling” financial losses.\n\nIn his written judgment, he recognised the implied term of mutual trust and confidence.\n\nIt is a rule in English common law that requires both employer and employee to act in a way that does not destroy or seriously damage the mutual trust and confidence between them.\n\nThe judge said SAP breached the term by behaving in an “intolerable or wholly unacceptable” way because it placed Mr Mudgal on the PIP even though it had the endgame of terminating his employment in mind.\n\n“In so doing, the defendant had prejudged the claimant and misled him into thinking that he was being given a genuine opportunity to improve his conduct and/or performance when this was not the case,” he added.\n\nJustice Gill noted that SAP had an “easy means” of dealing with Mr Mudgal by invoking the termination clause in the employment agreement.\n\n“Yet, this was not the remedy that the defendant immediately availed itself to. It imposed a farce of the PIP on the claimant,” he said.\n\nThe company is the Singapore-incorporated subsidiary of a German multinational corporation that develops software systems to manage business operations.\n\nMr Mudgal was head of services sales in the Asia-Pacific and Japan region for a line of cloud-based management software. He had a strained relationship with Ms Otsakchon Raman, head of services delivery for the same line of business in the Asia-Pacific and Japan and Greater China regions.\n\nThe events leading up to his termination centred on two incidents.\n\nOne incident in July 2018 arose from the transfer of a staff member, who was working on an ongoing project in India, from Ms Raman’s team to Mr Mudgal’s team.\n\nA series of e-mail exchanges between Ms Raman and a member of Mr Mudgal’s team led him to send an abrasive e-mail to Ms Raman, accusing her team of “gross incompetence”.\n\nAnother dispute in October 2018 over project timelines led Mr Mudgal to send an e-mail, with senior management copied, in which he attacked Ms Raman’s leadership and integrity.\n\nHe refused to apologise when asked to do so.\n\nIn November 2018, Ms Charmaine Seabury, the global vice-president of services sales, told human resources business partner Adele Teo-Gomez that there was “full alignment” among senior leaders on removing Mr Mudgal.\n\nOver a month, Ms Teo-Gomez and others from the employee relations department discussed the various options with Ms Seabury.\n\nMr Mudgal was formally placed on the PIP between March 21 and May 5 in 2019.\n\nOn Oct 25, 2019, Ms Seabury made it known that she wanted his employment to be terminated “as soon as possible”, saying that there were still issues with his conduct.\n\nThe notice of termination was served on Mr Mudgal on Nov 21. It stated that he would be placed on garden leave and that his last day would be Dec 31.\n\nThe judge said the evidence made it clear that Mr Mudgal was prejudged, pointing to the e-mails sent among various individuals including Ms Seabury, Ms Teo-Gomez and Ms Raman.\n\nPrior to Mr Mudgal being placed on the PIP, there were individuals within the management who were adamant about removing him from the company’s employment as soon as possible, he noted.\n\nJustice Gill said Mr Mudgal was never given a genuine opportunity to improve. “The attitude which Ms Seabury bore towards the claimant, namely her desire to terminate his employment as soon as possible, persisted even after she formally placed him on the PIP,” he added.\n\nHe noted that barely one month into the PIP, Ms Seabury told Ms Teo-Gomez that “we do not believe these changes in behaviour will be maintained” and that “we would like to remove him from the business as soon as possible”.\n\nThe judge added, however, that Mr Mudgal failed to show that his loss of future earnings flowed from the company’s conduct.\n\nMr Mudgal arrived at the figure of nearly $5 million by applying a “conservative” 10 per cent uplift to his annual future earnings from his last-drawn annual income of $665,673 in 2019, less his earnings to-date of $50,000. He claimed he has been unable to find employment despite applying for more than 300 jobs from 2020 to 2023.\n\nJustice Gill said: “I fail to see how (SAP’s) conduct would have had any bearing on (Mr Mudgal’s) employability in the labour market, much less caused him ‘irreparable damage to his ability to secure gainful employment’.”\n\nHe added that it was objectively easy to see how and why Mr Mudgal’s “self-righteous and unyielding behaviour” contributed to the hostility in an already volatile environment between the two teams.\n\n“He was, to a large extent, the author of his own misfortunes that culminated in the termination of his employment,” said Justice Gill.\n\n“The outcome of this case may well be a Pyrrhic victory for the claimant, but I hope that it will provide him with some vindication and allow him to move on with his life.”\n\nThe judge said the facts of this case showed why the implied term of mutual trust and confidence is needed. “There is nothing irreconcilable between the right to bring an employment relationship to an end and the duty not to behave in an intolerable or wholly unacceptable way,” he said.\n\nhttps://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/ex-employee-who-sued-software-firm-sap-for-5m-over-termination-gets-1000-in-pyrrhic-victory",

Excerpt from point 7: The study found that over a year, an average family that buys groceries weekly would save about 1,248 single-use plastic bags by switching to reusable bags for their groceries. 1,248 plastic bags per year for groceries is 24 bags per weekly visit - what?! How can that be for \"average family\"? So I went to the linkedLCA studyto get more information: Annex A, Paragraph 1: For this study, the functional unit was the volume of items a family of four would approximately buy over the course of one year. The functional unit is needed to determine how many of each type of bag are needed to carry the items. The study found that the functional use of 10 reusable bags (non-woven polypropylene or nylon bags) over a year is equivalent to the use of 1,248 plastic or degradable bags, or 520 paper bags. [...] (Under the photos)The study assumed that a family buys 50 items per week. The 50 items were placed in the different types of bags studied to determine how many of each type of bag were needed to carry the 50 items. The study doesn't say that 1,248 plastic bags are used in a year, just that 1 reusable bag provides 125 plastic bag worth of use. Because If they did use 1,248 plastic bags a year, or 24 bags per week, for the assumed 50 items bought per week, then this family is putting 2-3 items in each plastic bag? What? Additionally, the study \"assumed\" a family - that's not the \"average family\", neither is that \"on average\". That's just a hypothetical family. NEA's read on the study is completely bonkers. And even if they were right, if the average family does indeed use 24 bags per weekly visit, it means they'll now have to bring 24 disposable bags for that one visit - who the heck brings 24 disposable bag. If I weren't 3 years late, I'd have written in to NEA. Hello news outlets, here's a story for you.",

If you assume half the shoppers are just hand carrying their purchase, the other half are pushing full carts. This is absurd! Edit:So I went to page 14 and found this gem: The average number of grocery items per family was derived empirically by averaging the number of items bought by two families that fit the assumed criteria. Sample size of two. TWO. Only two families in their dataset fulfilled their criteria. That's clear evidence of \"not representative\". And the criteria: For this study, the functional unit of carrier bags was the volume of grocery items a family of four would buy approximately over the course of one year. It was assumed that the family of four comprised two adults and two children, and it was assumed that all meals were prepared at home and grocery shopping was done weekly. Our replacement rate is less than 1, i.e. the average family has 1 child. In 2022, more than 50% of households are dual-income i.e. fewer than all meals prepared at home.

As expected, there are road closures and motorists are advised to take alternative routes. Our Indian friends have been celebrating Thaipusam for many years already.\n\nI was discussing with a coworker, and he mentioned he was quite relieved that it falls on a Sunday this year, so he doesn’t need to take leave. And it would be nice if everyone could get one more public holiday, since Chinese and Malays already have two religious holidays each.\n\nWhy hasn’t Thaipusam been made a public holiday by now ? When it falls on a weekday, many people take leave anyway, which affects productivity regardless. Wouldn’t it make more sense to just formalise it as a PH ?\n\nAlso, Vesak Day is celebrated by Buddhists, who are mostly Chinese. I'm yet to meet a Indian Buddhist so I’m not entirely sure why Vesak Day is grouped under Indian holiday. Might be there in other countries. Happy to be corrected on this.\n\nAlso there is another festival pongul for Indians which is celebrated for a few days. Atleast give us 1 more PH la.\n\nCurious to hear what others think.\n\nEdit : I understand there are many other Indian communities other than Tamil. Respect that. I want to focus on Thaipusam since it is widely known.\n\nEdit : like someone mentioned I won't be surprised we might get a founder's day before we get another PH for Indians lol.",

This means lots of t-shirts. When Singaporeans holiday overseas, we don't have a lot of cold weather wear, and to save money, we often buy 1 big down jacket and/or buy as few garments as possible that can be used in the widest range of temperatures. This also means we often end up looking a little off-season. Big puffy down jackets in autumn, wearing t-shirts underneath the overcoat, layering like mad to make up for a lack of a good sweater or what. As opposed to local people who have garments that are suited/styled precisely to that weather, so when put next to locals who are very appropriately and fashionably dressed to that weather, we kind of stick out a little. Even in summer, foreigners don't just chiong tshirts/singlets and shorts. Some of the non-tropical countries opt for more sun protection rather than just wearing as little as possible.

I have been working overtime every alternate days and wanted to use my weekends resting and playing games . My mum straight up refuses to allow me to play my games, which i barely have time to even do that during weekdays. She expected me to work even during weekends to save money. She will said this is for my own good and i should grow up and not play games and i don't need to rest that much.\n\nAs i do not agree with her terms, i said so and she said just because i have a work now, i'm bold now and want to be rude to her. I literally just started working and i don't even have my pay yet and my mom is simply accusing me of this things when im just trying to stand out for myself. To make the situation worse, she called my older brother to solve the issue, just for her to twist her words as to why we're arguing. At the end of the day, she crashed out at my brother and accused him of things he didn't even do such as trying to defend me, just like how she accuses me of things i never did. My mom is the kind of person to accuse/ assume things without any proofs.\n\nNow, im currently staying over at my brother's home but i do not intend to stay here for a long time. I do not have any emergency savings (this is purely my fault, i should've save) so i do not know what should i do moving foward. Just earlier when i woke up, my mom sent two voice messages, saying that no matter how evil she is, she is my mom and said who am i to talk back. I felt even more frustrated as how could she, as a grown adult and a mother of 4 said that to me as if what she said was valid.\n\nI do not know what to do now, but what i do know is i do not intent to listen to her and not able to spend my free time simply playing games, not going out partying or doing nonsense stuff etc. I wish i have life savings to rent a place but now i'm just stuck.\n\nJust fyi, before getting kicked out and stuff, i have been running away from house and staying in camp to escape the toxicity 2 different times",

My house mates are so poor, their whole wardrobe can fit in a duffle bag. We all chip-in for house meal, which was basically rice + vege + cheap protein (mostly eggs). For me that was the first time to witness the real-life struggle. I moved in with a PC and two large luggage, I was the rich kid there. I remember one incident, when one of my roommate (Dentist) was graduating and he don't have anything nice to wear for ceremony. He don't want to buy new clothes just for that. I have to insist him to wear my clothes. During my stay there (4~5 years) I don't buy any new clothes because I felt like I have too many things compare to them. They were the one extracted my first wisdom tooth for free. My teachers gave me some side projects (IT related) to do part-time/contract so I can earn money and experience. A bit of tutoring here and there. Sometime help larger team to do their system implementation, assembling computers, on site users support (over night) during year end closing/inventory stock taking, data migration. Also prepare medical/engineering project/term paper documentation for submission for my house-mates, at first for free but they gave me pocket money. Later they connected me to their class mates (so I can earn money). After I moved out of that place, I worked in a restaurant for 7~8 months to clear my head. It was physically exhausting (F&B) but also my head was super clear, every night slept like a log. Money was solid because accommodation and all meals/drinks are provided, even for the off day. And no free-time or energy to spend money except play LAN game (CS) for a couple of hours. As long as you realized that you need money and have to work .. then you will find lots of work (might be bad/lousy/tiring or even dangerous) but still you will find them. Some of my classmates looked down on me for doing all sort of works, I don't give a damn about them. I still get higher scores than them in exams.",

Look... \"staying out till late\" and \"going on a solo trip\",are not the same thing. They are definitely \"quite different\". That said, I think your other trips are much more relevant, so focus on those. Consider the differences in those experiences:\n1. Length - were the other trips also of similar length? Every extra day is extra planning to be done.\n2. Destination - are those countries particularly safer? Or, nearer/easier to get to? What are the people typically like? \n3. Activities - did the trips revolve around city areas, or was there often terrain / environmental danger involved? \n4. Emergency plan - in the event of emergency, what's the plan? Who can you call, and who can your parents call? If there's a good difference in any of these questions, then that's probably what they're focused on. Otherwise, if your previous trips are very similar, you can try to drill down on what exactly is it that gives them so much pause. So that’s why I was disappointed that they didn’t trust me enough. It's often not you. As any driver will tell you, the biggest hazard on the road is \"other drivers\". The best driver in the world can still get into an accident as long as there's one other reckless person. They may not doubt your skill and independence, but rather the things/people that you are exposing yourself to.

Or if one person holds up other drivers, seemingly everyone behind them will lay on their horn, and oftentimes yell at them when going past. Also, I heard some people say Singapore is really dense, so I expected it to feel dense. But it didn't feel that dense to me at all.

I think a big difference is that the density peaks far higher in the US. There is a very dense downtown core with almost no residents that quickly spreads out into suburban sprawl. In Singapore, the business and commercial districts are less dense, which makes the densest areas feel more spacious, and conversely there isn't suburban sprawl, so even the most spread out areas feel comparable to or a little denser than an inner suburb like Evanston. It's also in part because Singapore operates more like what one might consider to be far bigger cities, like NYC, in that there are secondary business and commercial districts. I don't know Chicago specifically that well here, but in general in the US I'm used to needing to go downtown a lot. Singaporeans generally don't go to the CBD except to work because things are somewhat spread out around the island into a few other clusters as well. This is somewhat deliberate, as many \"towns\" in Singapore are designed to be somewhat self-contained for daily living. Having trees and parks also goes a long way.

Often, I clear paperwork on the weekends as well. My only reprieve is aiming to sleep 8 hours every day and occasionally spending time with my friends/partner.  Wake up, work, after work eat, come back sleep. No time for much else.\n\nI'm worried about burnout, both physically and mentally but can't quit because this is the best paying job in my field for a degree and I'm not remotely ready to do a Masters. Not to mention bond. I also don't want to burnout as it'll affect the quality of my work, something I cannot (afford to) compromise on.\n\nThe job gives me satisfaction and I leave everyday fulfilled, but dead tired and frustrated as I can't exactly enjoy my hobbies of gaming as weekends are often burnt planning for the week ahead or catching up on paperwork. I don't have time to exercise unless I cut gaming completely, which I don't exactly want to either.\n\nI know this sounds like a \"woe is me\" post but I'm not sure how better to cope. I'm slow af in my job and already am pacing it out so I can breathe while clearing as much shit as possible but it's just too much. I'm learning strategies from my colleagues but I feel it's a \"me\" thing to struggle.

My aunt works till 1/2am sometimes and wakes up at 5, my mom is permanently on her laptop rotating between work and YouTube everyday of the week. They also shared that I chose this job and it's \"life\". My partner is just as frustrated to the point the response is usually \"haiz... What can we do?\" Or \"well...\"\n\nEdit Edit: Genuinely appreciate all of the comments thus far. I really can't quit due to bond, and as mentioned in my comment, I'm only earning 4.5k which is not a lot (I'm already beating myself up earning this little at 30), while industry average (GOD BLESS) is 3k or lesser, with many of my former classmates struggling greatly to find work as it is saturated.

      "selftext": "Hi all, I have worked in the government job for 10 years, had various stints at statboard and ministries alike. most of the times, I get C or C+, though I never gotten Bs, but I was never the worst performer. Last week, I had been called in for a performance review to be put on PRP.\n\nGranted I am not a stellar performer, but I do my job diligently and try my best. In the first year, I think I was not performing up to standard according to my boss and was asked what are the reasons. I explained that I think there is a job mismatch but I will try my best to learn. However, I find the directions given to me very vague and a lot of times, I just could not nail it. My boss also mentioned that when she hired me, she thought that I am well-versed in handling media. However, I mostly did events  where some were quite high profile and were covered by medias. I guess it is on me that I thought that those were the same as media engagement.\n\nAfter 6 months, I realised that the scope of work is totally off and anything I proposed were just getting shot down. After that, I lost confidence and kept a low profile. I began doing menial tasks, get heavily involved in other department's work. after 1.5 years, I really just cant seem to get the grip of things.\n\nThat said, my bosses were not great, in fact, the entire department were complaining and looking for other job themselves. Naturally, I started the same and was lucky that I scored some interviews. Recently, I have a few second round interviews with other ministries/agencies, and am waiting for official offer.\n\nHowever, last week's performance review came, and they say that my grading will be recorded and it would be shared throughout the entire government record. They indirectly advise me to leave asap but I was adamant to stay for the bonus. We ended with that I will resign when I qualify for my bonus, which when she said to me that my \"bad\" grading would be included and stay in government records forever, and I better secure the offer before its being included as it would affect my future opportunities.\n\nAlso, not to play the blame game, my bosses are getting absolutely pummeled by the senior management team. Our senior management also commented that the middle management (my bosses) are not up to standard, which further validates my view that as much as I am not up to standard, they cannot just pin all the blames on me alone...\n\nLet say in worse case scenario, I get Ds/Es, how screwed am I? Also, I am afraid that once the PRP sets in, HR would inform my potential new hiring agency/ministry that I am currently on PRP and drop me after HR checks... thanks in advance!\n\n*Edit: My bosses also claimed to have provided email coaching, which for the record, I do not receive much. There is not even face to face consultation. When she asked for a piece of work, I would complete it, check through with my colleague (who is supposedly the best performer) and get her green light. But she will come back with not good enough etc. I have recorded and documented our last 3 months email exchanges and I am quite sure not one is a 'coaching' email... Heck, what is 'receiving coaching through emails' anyway???",

The debt repayment scheme allows you to manage the debt but musn't be more than 5 years. So, at best, it would be around $1,677 per month.

You don't know if the car breaks down and how much the repairs would be in the next 10 years or so.

Jayakumar (then 65) would probably have been Tony Tan's DPM. The top job would be too early for guys like Teo Chee Hean, George Yeo, Tharman and Ng Eng Hen (all in their late 40s to early 50s) so they would be ministers in this hypothetical PM Tan's cabinet, with Teo probably becoming PM#4 by 2010 in time to lead the party into GE 2011.",

In the present time, he constantly compares the role of the party to the role of the church and the pope. He might even elevate the party because the party is racially Chinese while the Vatican is of the west. The transition from GCT to LHL nearly got Sg this guy. The transition from LHL to LW took a decade and resulted in the PAP’s 3rd choice. I wonder if any of the old fogeys will spill the tea on how GCT really got selected… I think that these events strongly underline the need for a strong opposition. GY still has significant favourability in the PAP. They needed the help of the opposition to purge him and his faction. There are a lot of nominal PAP supporters who have authoritarian, Chinese racialist views and seditious tendencies towards Beijing.

If u just came out of cs degree, python’s one of the most sought after skills, put that in the resume and maybe a Git link to a sample app, no need for anything fancy. One that demonstrates ur understanding of algorithms and if u have the time which u probably do, design a well structured one. One that caters to the user’s interactions (UX and UI) impresses most. It could be an app or site that only has a basic page with a list of products on it or whatever, and a login page. If u dont have any of that, then i think it’s time to brush or pick up some skills… youtube and chatGpt is a good source to develop one. Interviewers would be interested in ur thought process during the creation of the app/site - why did u design it this way? How did u do this login page or how do u authenticate and authorise the users? Is the site/app scalable? What’s the architectural design behind this (mvc, mvvm etc)? Thats only if u dont have buffed portfolios like 90% of the fresh grads out there… i have some crazy fresh grad friends that participated/won hackathons, interned at some big named companies and/or has personal projects that can blow one’s minds… Make ur resume stand out and highlight ur best points, essentially coming back to my point - sell the shit out of urself.

Tech industry is incredibly terrible right now due to multiple of factors (e.g. AI, Trump, outsourcing, weaken economic outlook, tech bubble burst, bootcamps) I know a couple of 5 to 10 years veterans who are still jobless for more than a year now. The situation is much more grim for fresh graduates who is now completing with more experienced professionals who is willing to price themselves lower. I also notice the tone from tech recruiters who give career advise have change and become more pessimistic, from \"Just cold call and tailor your resume, you will land a role within months\" to \"Expect not being able to get in the industry for 1 to 2 years\" i applied even to listings up to a month old and i focused on all tech entry level jobs or jobs not directly tech but accepted tech background, these contribute to the high numbers Is good that you apply for adjacent roles, consider applying for roles that need your skills and capabilities, even if is not an even 50% match from your expectations. Here is what I recommend/suggest: Option A - If you really really want to get into tech: A stellar resume. A lot lecturers and some career consultant give shit advise on resume because they have been out of the force for a quite awhile. Avoid those aesthetics resume, I notice a lot of my SWE pals have \"fun\" looking resumes that are very difficult to read for HR/recruiter, so they end up in the discard pile. See what common phases and keywords that is written in the JDs, try to input those keywords organically and tailor it. Use ChatGPT if you need help but DON'T BLINDLY ACCEPT IT, take a scan, it has tendencies input random achievements. Expand your network via hackathons, voluntary, networking events if someone has a connection in a role you are interested in they can refer you in organisations or give you advise. This also shows you are passionate about the field. I landed in my current role, because I met 2 people in a community event, one of them give me tips on what to say for that company and other is the colleague of the interviewer, so they vouched for me. Upskill yourself, show you are passionate and willing to learn. Explain how such skills/courses make you a more valuable employee. \"I learn x software, which means I can assist and read Y\". As you scan the JDs, keep a lookout on common skills and keywords they used. Continue be open to roles is adjacent to the industry and roles you have the skill for, since you need a foot in. Example, data analytic, Quality Assurance, Business Analytics, IT Support etc. Lastly, I want to acknowledge the feeling and the experience you have is valid, the economy for tech is bad.

Meaning, they are able to reflect on their life choices and adjust to changes. They adapt and grow stronger. They put effort into working on what they want to improve on. If they don't own a place and they want a place, they will find a way to get rental or 2 room minimally. They won't look at others who live in prime areas with Instagram interiors and start to envy. If they want to travel, they will adapt their travels to their circumstances and be at peace. It does not matter how much money they have but they have self-respect. They have a mindset full of dignity. They have MY respect. Warning: incoming harsh words. But you're late 30s, so what the point of gentle words? Maybe you're in this mindset because people have been too gentle to you all along. You're in denial, claiming you're not comparing with others. But you use the word \"competitive\" in your post.

The fact that you're complaining that you have no inheritance and then comparing with what the news reported is frankly pathetic. Basically, your post shows that you are bitter and stressed....about not being handed enough money on a platter. You have internalized certain Asian expectations without thinking for yourself despite all those years of education. Secretly, because of this mindset, you judge others according to these milestones and are now turning to judge yourself needlessly. You need therapy.

Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.3But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,4so that your giving may be in secret.

He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, ‘God, have mercy on me, a sinner.’ 14“I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.” Luke 18:9-14 As a Christian myself, it pains me when these people \"speak\" for us and are made to be an blanket example that all Christians are like this.To fellow Christians, do not be dismayed or discouraged, just keep up your faith and do according to what scriptures says.",

Matthew 5:38-42 However, the actual interpretation of this verse is to say that the punishment is to be proportional to the crime, rather than an ever-escalating cycle of revenge.

          "text": "This isn’t accurate at all. 1.LKY never regretted giving women equal rights or education. I can pull up comments he made in the 1980s and even right before he died where he reaffirmed this. LKY was obsessed with raising the quality of Singapore’s demographics, which is why education was always treated as the top national priority and why Singapore built one of the strongest education systems in the world. His goal was to maximize the potential of every Singaporean citizen through education. At the same time, he believed there was a limit to what even the best education could do, and that IQ and true brilliance were genetic. That is why he was concerned when Singaporean men began marrying uneducated women rather than educated or highly capable Singaporean women. From his perspective, this lowered the overall quality of the population over time. This is also why he pushed the Graduate Mothers Scheme and placed such strong emphasis on educating women, while seeing women as half of the workforce and recognizing that it made no sense not to educate them. He acknowledged that when women are educated, birth rates tend to decline as women want more out of life, and that this creates challenges between the sexes. Men often struggled with dating women who were smarter than them, earned more than them, or were harder to lead in traditional ways. LKY understood that this disrupted traditional male–female dynamics. He handled this with nuance. On one hand, he openly challenged men’s insecurities, saying he himself was never intimidated by women who were smarter than him and that he actively sought out his wife, who beat him to valedictorian. On the other hand, he acknowledged that certain forms of feminism could push women toward being more masculine and adversarial in marriage rather than complementary. He even commented on how Japan limited women’s access to universities and instead sent many to finishing schools where they still received rigorous education but were also taught how to be good partners to their husbands. LKY clearly saw the early stages of the men–women dating divide we see today and was trying to address it rather than deny it. 3.As for alimony in divorce and presumption of guilt, I don’t see any extreme bias against men. If anything, it appears the opposite. LKY and the PAP consistently tried to prevent the system from becoming ideologically skewed or hostile toward men, unlike what we now see in the United States in divorce proceedings that do heavily favor the women and cancel culture sexual misconduct accusations.",

And it'll feel like the below image...\n\nMe yelling into the void that is the internet and this sub.\n\nBut before you set a goal to \"fire your boss\" in 3 years or dump your savings into the market hoping for a miracle, I want to say \"Investments won't make you rich (probably)\".\n\nThere is a lot of noise on social media (tiktok and youtube) selling the idea that the stock market is a \"get rich quick\" vehicle. Most veterans in this sub area already familiar with this fact.\n\nBUT I want to argue a slightly unpopular point,Passive invest-ing (index funds) will strictly NOT make you rich.However, it is the most reliable way to secure a modest, comfortable retirement.\n\nThis is geared towards the new people...\n\nMy friend, it's not about being a billionaire. It's about havingenough. This amount is unique to everyone and is definitely achievable for everyone, given that they follow these simple steps:\n\nSecure your short term goals first in safer-assets.\n\nDon't excessively spend and start saving & invest-ing. Any amount is sufficient, but for you to reach your goal quicker, it's in your best interest to save more. (But of course to enjoy life, its up to you to find that balance).\n\nInvest in a well-diversified, broad-based low-cost index fund. (Sub's favorites are VWRA and CSPX).\n\nStay invested.\n\nFirst, we have to define terms. When most people say they want to be \"Rich,\" they mean being able to flex the purchase of a Lamborghini, quitting their job in 5 years, or flashing a Rolex.\n\nWhen we talk about a \"Modest Retirement\" or being \"Wealthy,\" we mean financially independent. The ability to maintain your standard of living without working, usually achieved over decades.\n\nIndex funds are a tool for the latter, not the former. If your goal is a yacht by 30, index funds are mathematically thewrongtool for you.\n\nInvest-ing is amultiplier, not agenerator.\n\nMany people obsess over \"beating the market\" to get an extra 1% return, while ignoring that their principal investment is too small to matter.\n\nYou cannot index-fund your way out of a low income (or a low savings rate). To get to that modest retirement, you must focus on your \"Shovel\" (your active income/career) to fuel the engine. The savings rate matters infinitely more than the rate of return for the first decade of your journey.\n\nTo illustrate this, assume we have 2 people, one person who invests $500 a month @ 8% p.a. and another person who invests $200 a month @ 20% p.a.\n\nWho do you think has a higher portfolio value at the end of 10 years?\n\nSavings rate matters alot.\n\nIf you guessed $500 a month at 8% p.a., that is right! Yes, from the graph, you can see that given a couple more years the 20% p.a. guy is going to overtake the 8% p.a. guy. But that requires someone to average 20% p.a. for more than 10 years.\n\nYou literally need to be Warren Buffett to emulate this.\n\nLet's look at the actual numbers. Let's say you have$10,000to invest and the market returns a historical average of8%. (I know it's higher than the conservative estimateI always use of 6%, but it helps getting the point across okay. SHHH)\n\n30+ years is a long time. It’s a career. That is the definition of a \"modest retirement.\" It is slow and boring... (It also doesn't help that most of us think that$1M might not be enough).\n\nIf you're curious how long it'll take to reach $1,000,000 based on a 8% p.a. return and xxx contribution...\n\nIt really does plateau after a while...\n\nIf you're curious as to how this graph looks like if you're assuming an even moreconservativereturn of5.5% p.a.(maybe due to SGD strengthening against USD or you have a more diversified portfolio and you're trading returns for significantly reduced volatility...)\n\nThe same trend appears where it looks like it sorts of plateau after a while...\n\nJust for funsies (and[censored]and giggles). What if you want to be \"Rich\" quickly? What if you want that same $10,000 to turn into $1 million in just10 yearswithout adding extra monthly contributions?\n\nTo achieve this, you would need an Annualized Rate of Return (CAGR) of~58.5%.\n\nThis is almostimpossible, the data I get areall from here(setting the years to be the last 100 years):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/btoi0d2ljafg1.png?width=873&format=png&auto=webp&s=da28dab35ebe4f5b9c1ee515c37b11c449fddb90\n\nTo chase a 58% annual return long term, you physicallyCANNOTuse index funds. You are forced into high-risk vehicles:0DTE options, leveraged crypto,orpicking penny stocks.And we know how well that turns out for some people over at a certain WSB subreddit. (if the /s is not conveyed properly, this is a VERY bad idea...)\n\nMathematically, attempting to get \"Rich\" quickly forces you into a risk bracket where you are statistically likely to go to $0. Accepting \"modest\" returns is the only thing that protects you from total ruin.\n\nAccording to data from theSpectrem Group (and similar wealth surveys), most deca-millionaires(and similar wealth surveys), most deca-millionaires(it's a plain bagel video I know, but he breaks it down pretty well here) did not get there by getting lucky on a single stock pick or crypto coin. They built wealth through:\n\nThe Money Guys also did a similar survey on their millionaire clients and point 1) also pops up.\n\nInvest-ing was simply the place theyparkedthe wealth they had already created to keep it safe and growing. It was not the source of the wealth creation itself.\n\nMy friend, it's not about being a deca-millionaire or even a billionaire. It's about havingenough. This amount is unique to everyone and is definitely achievable for everyone, given that they follow these simple steps:\n\nDisclaimer: I used AI to format this post, but the thoughts & graphs are all mine. (Some of the thoughts come from the plain bagel video whose information I want to share with yall :) )",

To the point that my first bank account was created because I needed one to credit my Edusave award, and promptly taken over by my parents for daily necessities. All along, my parents told me never to touch stocks. Investment was a taboo word. Apparently, before they had me, my parents burnt more than $100k. Till today, they refused to tell me what happened. Many folks have told me to invest. I know. But when I was in my 20s, I was scared. Scared of my hard earned monies evaporating. Just like my parents’. I didnt like asking around too. Because personal finance is personal - you ask people, you are going to receive tonnes of answers. Some obviously have an agenda (like … SIGN UP FOR MY MASTERCLASS TO LEARN HOW TO BE A WARREN BUFFET OVERNIGHT).

I remembered I dipped my toes into Syfe robo-investment in 2022, and when I saw my portfolio dip I cashed it out straightaway. Rookie mistake of emotional investment.

So nowadays I just say I am managing my own investments which is also true. The other question which I hated is, what do you do every day? Every day, I just go to the gym, read some books, catch up on my favourite shows, even death scroll on tiktok. Then I fuss about what to cook or eat for lunch and dinner and coffee. Then people may judge and think you are wasting your life away. But I feel even doing nothing and enjoying simple things in life is not a waste of time. Another thing I need to get used to is people assume I have rich parents who bought my property and gifted everything to me, when in reality I bought everything with my own earnings and income.

IFAs are often not fee-based, they just sell multiple insurance company products and earn commission, so make sure you don’t use this type. Endowus is a very decent mix of user-friendly with acceptable fees. IBKR is cheapest for many things (including Pimco GIS Income Fund) but not so easy to use. The Pimco GIS Income Fund is a ”bond-focus fund”. The bonds inside are a bit more risky and somehow they use some leverage, so the payouts are higher. There are slightly different “flavours” as well, like Pimco GIS Diversified Income Fund. Money market fund is very safe, but the returns are under 1.5% p.a. now so it won’t help you meet your goal of ~5% p.a. in “dividends”. And don’t get tricked into USD mmf with higher interest because the FX risk will just get you instead. Other products that I think could help you are 1) Allianz Income and Growth (can get thru Endowus for lower fees). This is about 1/3 US equities and 2/3 bonds, but the bonds are the riskier type and half perform more like equities. Read this for a more thorough explanation of pros and cons: https://investmentmoats.com/fund/allianz-income-growth-good-returns-for-past-3-years-sustain-7-income-yield/ 2) Amova Singapore Dividend Equity Fund (can’t  buy directly from Endowus, but you can buy from Poems or Dollardex then transfer to Endowus, and Endowus will let you buy more after that).  This is composed of Singapore stocks and gives out 5% p.a. dividends monthly while doing a pretty good job of maintaining or growing capital. A bit less bank-heavy than the Straits Times Index, and you pay higher fees but they solve the monthly payout problem for you. S-REITs also inside, so it’s good for “dummies”. People will probably tell you to invest in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for the lowest fees, but then you need to sell to create your “dividend”, and it requires more financial literacy.

Yield is high for all classes but is also because it doesn't take into account hedging cost. USDSGD hedging cost now, with how volatile the USD is, probably is >2% p.a., this will come out of your NAV. On yields, well lots of nations now are looking at USD in a different light, even if they do have more rate cuts it's likely the yields won't move much at all, hence it's duration position won't offer much upside. Long story short, NAV likely to erode, your 6% dividend net of fees and hedging cost, is typically closer to 3%, assuming spreads stay tight and yields are constant On AIG the dividend yield stated is not an organic yield. The organic yield of the fund is closer to 2+ 3%, due to its mix of HY bonds, convertibles and equities that are ALL US centric.

So the brain fills the gap with anxiety.\nOne thing I wish I understood earlier: milestones like “1M” or “own place” aren’t destinations. They’re just coordinates along a much longer path.\nAt 28, the most valuable asset you’re building isn’t the 200k. It’s the fact that you’re already on a stable, compounding trajectory.\nThe danger isn’t renting or buying late. It’s letting future goals make the present feel like failure.\nIf I could tell my younger self one thing, it’d be this:\ndon’t judge your life using endgame metrics while you’re still in the accumulation phase.\nYou’re not behind.

My income is very fluid - some months under $2k, other months $5k or more (Background: I manage marketing projects). Ad-hoc expenses drain my income quickly. There have been times when I saw only two digits in my bank account, which is very demoralising. I am turning to the Reddit community for advice.

To be honest, he gave up telling me or teaching me what to do, so he took the \"easier\" approach of \"Ok, I take care of you.\" Oops.\n\nYou know how some people work - tough love will not help them learn, but when taken a gentle approach, suddenly one will wake up and want to do better.

Over time, the app generated a decent amount of income (won’t disclose specifics), and he eventually sold it.\n\nThat conversation got me thinking.\n\nFor those in Singapore, what are some common or unconventional ways people build side income or side gigs outside of their main job?

Here are my thoughts, your conclusion you draw yourself :) Webn: (idk where you saw 0.15% ter, I got 0.07% ter) Pros: lowest TER. Tracks solactive index, 99% correlation with MSCI ACWI. Cons: not exactly tracking the \"main brand\" indices so future performance may vary. Just launched (2024), low volume and shorter track record. Note: EUR, not in USD according to what I found. So idk how it might work with IBKR, I assume no change but im not 100% sure. fwra: Pros: VWRA but cheaper + instead of Vanguard, its invesco. Cons: low volume, relatively new as well. vwra: Pros: high liquidity, broader than ACWD in terms of \"coverage\", vanguard is a giant and staple company for investments. Cons: higher TER, no exposure to small caps. acwd Pros: lower cost than VWRA and still covers decent coverage. Cons: not as much coverage as VWRA. lower volume. imid Pros: has large; medium; and small caps. Similar TER than the rest given the \"coverage\" in markets. Cons: low volume, sampling risk (they dont buy ALL the stocks but a sample instead), and exposure to small caps means higher volatility. IMID might be worth to look to get \"everything\" but if you want cost efficiency for similar coverage to vwra, ACWD / WEBN might be good. If you want definitely more \"safe\" because of the holding company, you cant go wrong with vanguard.",

CSPX/SPY also has a rather high P/E ratio of 31 at the moment partly due to the forward-looking AI theme compared to many other countries.

Small caps from EIMI over time should add exposure and better fund performance in the long run, which should outperform ACWD's TER of 0.12% But its really marginal. If you want more small cap exposure there's some offerings by DFA(Dimensional Fund Advisors), but you really should understand that its an actively managed ETF that's not just market cap weighted ETF. Therefore the TER for DFA is higher. DFA to me is super interesting, but you have to know they haven't beat the market in the last few years because the large cap US stocks have performed so well in the last few cycles. By the way that they do their fund, it will increase the exposure to small cap stocks, value stocks. They also recently launched Irish docimiled ETFs. They actively use finance research, and their funds are designed to beat the market, which prior to the tech rally, they do beat vanguard's funds and sometimes do beat the market. I am not paid in anyway by those funds or youtube videos, just like you are curious what others think. I'm personally leaning to SWRD+EIMI just for the time being as DFA irish funds are super new aka low liquidity. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfknibBat2A https://www.dimensional.com/us-en/etfs",

Taking into account that ACWD already tracks so many entities, thus the fact that they are only 0.12 in TER compared to VWRA probably means over the long-term they should have a higher returns of achieving better returns? Just curious, if you guys have any ETFs to recommend other than VWRA where I feel that the 0.19 TER will eat into my profits over the long run.

I have just received an offer to relocate to Singapore with a salary of 12k SGD/month (local contract), and the company would fully cover health insurance.\n\nWe are a family of four, with two children aged 1 and 3. My wife would not be working, at least initially. From your experience, do you think a salary of 12k SGD/month would provide a quality of life comparable to what we currently have in France/Nantes?\n\nWe are also considering enrolling our children in the French school in Singapore, so feedback from families in a similar situation would be especially appreciated.\n\nThank you in advance for your advice!\n\nEDIT: Thank you so much for the advice !",

However, rent/mortgage is much cheaper than in Singapore. I used to live in an 89msq apartment in Lyon, eur1.1k rental, plus electricity et tout, we're about eur1.5k fixed cost. Here, 80+msq is about a 3 bedroom apartment, you'd be looking at about sgd3k onwards, possibly sgd5k if you want to live closer to town/less local. However, eating out is slightly cheaper in Singapore, so at least that you can maintain. Someone talked about schooling, we paid maybe eur500 for our crèche, but here you'd be looking at around sgd1.5k and up for a private sch. Mais si tu va un crèche français, oulala ça va coût très cher. Additionally, we had a lot of free stuffs to do, places to visit cheaply (just driving) while we lived in France. Yes, there are free stuffs to do, but I estimate about a year in, you'd get bored of the beaches and parks and playgrounds that you can access for free. So you have to budget for travels as part of your expenditure. The last thing is about your wife. If she's not working, it can get tough socially.

If mainstream FI are finally recommending gold, it’s going to get crowded. But to hedge against currency debasement you’ll need gold. Holding just equities is not enough. Because there is a regime change. Understand what the US is trying to do. The US debt  and the interest on their debt is unsustainable. They need to lower interest rates. The fed can cut rates but that will only influence rates on the short end of the bond yield. They can’t control the long end. One idea that’s been floated is to allow the USD to devalue. But devalue against what?  They can allow it to devalue against gold. At the US treasury, gold has a statutory price of $42+. This was set in the 1970s and they have not revalued this. What treasury could do is to revalue gold, mark it to market and suddenly the treasury has “free” money, which they can sell to the Fed. Fed prints the dollars. This is just accounting to give the US treasury new “money”. In addition to this, the Genius act which allow private companies to issue stable coins that are backed by treasuries is a natural buyer of short duration bonds and bills. This helps keep the short term borrowing cost down. But the clarity act allows these stables coins to generate yield. companies like Tether are taking these yields and buying gold. Tether has one of the largest non-nation entity holding gold. Guess what the US government could do? They could ask Tether to back (buy) US long duration treasuries with their gold thus making US treasuries gold-backed. This would massively devalue the US currency but allow them to control yield at the long end, meaning they can borrow at a lower rate. In the end bond holders suffer and a massive transfer of purchasing power go to holders to gold Central banks were already sniffing this eventuality out years ago. Even Singapore has started increasing our gold reserves. 100% equity is not it anymore. That worked well 25-30 years ago. The regime has changed. How you invest must also adapt.",

But there must be a distinction to be made here that the allocation is part of portfolio construction right from the start, instead of having gold allocation just because you want to jump on the hype train. According to the modern portfolio theory, investors are compensated with higher expected returns only by taking on additional systematic risk. However, this total portfolio risk can be optimised by adding uncorrelated asset classes. This allows an investor to reduce overall volatility without necessarily sacrificing the portfolio's expected return. Historically, gold has maintained very low correlation to equities (between 0 to 0.3). This means that gold's price movement is largely independent of the stock market. This improved stability results in better sharpe ratio, signifying higher return per unit of risk taken. In terms of portfolio rebalancing, having a predetermined allocation also allows you to invest in the \"cheaper\" asset. For example, my target allocation for gold in my portfolio is 10%. As of the most recent price movement, my gold allocation has surged to 11%. This allows me to avoid putting more money into gold (since it is overweight and \"expensive\") and channel my incoming funds into the relatively \"cheaper\" equities instead.",

So for the next 5-6 months I did exclusively that, just transferring the monies into another bank account that I don’t use. Once I “finished” my emergency funds, I just started depositing the same amount about $1.2K into my IBKR per month. Whatever amount I deposit into IBKR I just bought VWRA. *Not using any HYSA or what, but I tried to achieve the max interest thing on UOB One but it’s inconsistent for me as I was always struggling to charge $500 spending on the card so I gave up months later. If you think you can do that + credit your Salary into your UOB One, I think it’s a good option because I just checked my UOB One and it gives up to 3.4% p.a (up to first 100K I think?)",

      "selftext": "Single, approaching 30, still living with parents. Just landed a new role with take home est. 4.5k / mth and expect monthly expenses to be ard 7-800 a mth. So leaving me abt 3.6k to deploy. Goal is to not keep too much cash parked in bank and try to deploy them for investments as much as possible.\n\nPortfolio now is Abt 220k in equities and 30k cash (just sitting in bank, not even in Money Market Funds).\n\nRisk appetite is probably more risk on, more tolerant to drawdowns. Don't foresee selling except for portfolio rebalancing. No commitment to any form of real estate yet. For my individual stocks I have no plans to sell unless I see worsening fundamentals.\n\n1) How much do you allocate between stocks, fixed income, cash component in a month? Or your suggestion for my scenario\n\n2) I don't have any fixed income / gold component in my portfolio atm.\n\nRather was thinking it would provide me more liquidity to double down on equities if there's a dip. Was thinking about Money Market Funds, Gold or currency hedged TIPS ETFs (if they exist)\n\nAlso welcome opinions from folks who allocate fixed income to take a market view, for portfolio diversification or for capital preservation.\n\n3) also thinking maybe running cash secured put or wheeling strategies on individual equities / index ETFs I am willing to take ownership for long horizon (essentially just long these equities).\n\nObjective is just...long these equities for the long run, but also like able to buy them at discounts. If the options are OTM then collect premium until I can buy at more favourable price\n\nWhat are things to be aware of? Eg. Do you need to fund your option positions fully, How do you decide your strikes and maturity dates, decide your entry and exit, determine whether the Implied Vols are too high or low, choice of security, managing your Greeks, do you (and when) do you roll them and whether you let them expire (with the risk of getting assigned) etc, basically everything I need to know & your experience.\n\n(My knowledge of options lies mainly in pricing and Greeks, hence would be find it v helpful for both my job in market risk and investments on how do you trade options)\n\n5) How frequent and when do you rebalance your portfolios? Do you just simply change the allocation to different asset classes while keeping total capital invested the same or you will rebalance by doing a lump sum investment in a particular asset class to change your portfolio weightages while increasing amount of capital invested.\n\n4) I remember/u/firepathlionis able to leverage on index ETF.  Question to ppl who run leveraged strategies on long equities: how you manage / balance between the risk of higher exposure to equities via leverage vs the risk of getting margin called and not having enough cash to top up your margin account?\n\nAppreciate quality answers!",

For example, by leaving money in an MMF to buy the dip (aka war-chest), yes it feels very shiok when the dip comes, but if you look at what the price was back when you first put the money into the MMF, chances are you would have come out on top by DCAing. ““Far more money has been lost by investors preparing for corrections, or trying to anticipate corrections, than has been lost in corrections themselves”—a famous quote.",

          "text": "I sell CSP, CC and sometimes naked calls. I’ve been doing it for quite awhile now and only with 3 or 4 tickers that I’ve watched over a few years. Honestly speaking, I don’t go so deep into the whole fundamental of Greeks despite having knowledge in it. I research more about the company, track their earnings, and mark down specific price levels that I am willing to take assignment and/or am ok to sell them off at. I don’t leverage and don’t trade on margin, so everything is cash ready if ever it goes south. I recognize the volatility of this so I take it as a riskier portion of my entire portfolio. I go for 3weeks to a max of 6 weeks DTE, and aim for $80-$100 premium per week for every $20k of ready capital. I don’t have much advice except for the fact that knowledge of Greeks and pricing doesn’t amount to anything when your options hit and shoot past your strike. It all boils down to how confident you are in the tickers you chose base on your research and whether or not you can stomach it. P.S I have panic closed positions in my early days for exorbitant prices only to regret later.",

Meanwhile just try a cheap stable stock like SOFI to get the hang of wheeling options. 30-45dte, 0.2delta is good.",
