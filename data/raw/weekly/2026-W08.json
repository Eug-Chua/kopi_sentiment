      "selftext": "TLDR: Very poor management by the parties involved, Scoot and the Airport, from scheduled takeoff to actual arrival took 12hours+\nsome ppl (including elderlies and ppl on crutches) only received food 9 hours later and went without sleep throughout the entire ordeal, did not receive on ground transport and hotel contrary to Scoot's statement. \n\n\nI was unfortunately on flight TR 497 from KL to SG which Scoot said: \"affected customers were provided with accommodation, refreshments and on-ground transport.\" Over here https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/scoot-flight-from-kuala-lumpur-on-feb-9-cancelled-after-technical-fault-detected\n\n\nSurprised to read about the Refreshment and passengers being sent to hotel to rest, as quite a few of us had a totally different experience, went about 9 hours without food or rest.\n\nTill today, we have not heard directly from Scoot (although we booked through trip.com who reached out to us so wondering if Scoot only communicated with passengers who booked directly).\n\nWhile I can understand the technical issues was unexpected, Scoot's handling of the cancellation was extremely disappointing, there was lack of communication, clarity and proper process. \n\nWe only managed to get our boarding pass about 9 hours later, after much detours and abrupt changes, without sleep or food (even though Scoot mentioned providing Refreshments, it seemed like most passengers did not received it). Only arrived back in Singapore at around 12pm the following day, which meant the need to apply for leave from work.\n\nNevertheless, it was an interesting experience, we quickly became friends with strangers, including an elderly Korean lady who was travelling alone and anxious. When we finally boarded the next flight back 12 hours later, we saw many fellow passengers  who bonded and helped each other through the arduous 12 hours, taking pictures and biding farewell even though they did not speak the same language.\n\n\n-Sat on the runway for about an hour before the crew finally informed us of the issue\n\n-Only offered plain water at 12am. When we requested for snacks, after a 2 hours delay into a supposedly 1 hour flight, the crew informed us we had to purchase in flight meals\n\n-There was another airplane stuck behind us for about 3 hours since our flight was blocking access to the takeoff runway, it was eventually towed away\n\n-Could feel the Captain was empathetic which is appreciated, however, there were multiple occasions when they didnt update us for up to an hour even though they announced they would in 20 mins etc\n\n-Once we arrived back at the terminal, the nightmare continued, total chaos and lack of clarity + communication \n\n-There was a long queue to enter the only lift which would bring us inside  the airport, once we exited the lift we were told to head to counter P9\n\n-After queuing for a long time to enter P9, the other passengers in front of us suddenly turned around and walked towards the opposite direction, the staff did not communicate anything, we only found out through word of mouth from other passengers that P9 was for passengers who would like to cancel and get a refund.\n\n-It seemed like Refreshments were being distributed at P9 so we ended up with zero Refreshment as we had to follow the queue of ppl walking in the opposite direction if we're would like to take the next earliest flight by SIA.\n\n-Again, through word of mouth, at around 2 or 3 am, we were told that we would be heading to sunway pyramid hotel which was about an hour away, this created a lot of unrest among the weary passengers (many haven't eaten or rest since 10pm). It didnt make sense to travel to the hotel, spend proably an hour or two, or maybe even lesser accounting for potential traffic jam,  waiting time to check in hundreds of passengers,before travelling another hour back to the airport as we heard the earliest flight was around 9/10am (checked with the staff if we could opt for a later flight to get some rest if we were to go to the hotel but they seemed as lost as we were). At this point there was a queue of a few hundred passengers waiting to exit the immigration which would take some time too\n\n-When we finally exited immigration, a lot of us lost sight of the staff and did not know where to board the bus to the hotel, some passengers who did not speak English were very anxious\n\n-We ended up making friends with other passengers to share info and figure things out, \"adopting\" an elderly Korean who was travelling alone and spoke no English as she looked anxious\n\n-since we lost sight of the staff, about a hundred of us gathered at Scoot's terminal, which was unfortunately not opened yet\n\n-after some time a staff finally came to Scott's counter and told us to follow her to board the bus to the hotel\n\n-while waiting (what seems like an hour) for the bus,  at about 5am the staff told us we will not be travelling to the hotel anymore,  but head to the next terminal to board the 10am flight to Singapore\n\n-the airport shuttle bus which is used by the public to the terminal was full which led to even more waiting\n\n-once we boarded the bus, we were surprised to see the staff not onboard,  we were expected to make our own way, some passengers alighted at the wrong stop and we had to help inform them\n\n-finally reached SIA terminal at about 6am and got our boarding pass, close to 9 hours since the scheduled takeoff and about 6 hours since we disembarked from the plane\n\n-the staff at the counter seemed unaware about the flight cancellation and was surprised to hear our flight was supposed to take off 10 hours ago\n\n-we were finally issued 35RM meal voucher, proceed to have our first meal in 10 hours with our newfound friends and the elderly Korean passenger\n\n-quite a few of us had difficulty entering the departure hall as the Malaysian immigration doesn't seem to be aware of the flight cancellation, some ended up spending more than an hour after being sent on a wild goose chase by the immigration officers who did not knew how to handle passengers from the cancelled flight\n\nOverall a very tiring but interesting experience\n\n\nEdit\n1. We didnt really had time to get food as the staff told us to follow them, from the moment we dismebarked to the moment we were reissued a new boarding pass, it was endless waiting and queueing at immigration, bus stop etc as you can read from above. If u wandered off the get food you might get left behind. It would have been a different story if there was clear communication as to where to reschedule our flights as opposed to asking a few hundred ppl to follow them without much info.\n\n2. The point of this post is to highlight how the process was extremely disorganised and disappointing. Funny to see some snarky and strange comments focusing on 3rd party booking lol. From what we saw, Passengers who booked direct + 3rd party went through the same process and got the same treatment. They were so disorganised I doubt they even knew who booked direct and who booked through 3rd party.\n\n3. I am not sure how flight cancellation is typically handled, but yes it seems like it wasn't solely Scoot which mismanaged. We suspect tue staff who spoke to us were from KLIA, so we proably had zero contact with anyone from Scoot.\n\n4. While it was an incredibly fustrating and anxious experience, a minor few were condescending in their interaction with the staff, which was pretty ugly. At the end of the day, everyone is just trying their best, the staff looked as lost as we were, they dont make the SOPs and seemed to be poorly trained, which isnt their fault. They are just junior employees who probably have zero decision making powers, not right to act out on them.\n\n5.  Most ppl were kind and helpful; kindness cuts across language barriers and nationality, strangers turned into friends who looked out for one another since we had no one else to rely upon.",

Ground handling was chaotic with no clear communication, no directions, and no proper coordination. \n\nContrary to what was reported in the news article, none of us got any timely transport or hotel accommodation. We literally disembarked the plane at 2 15 am leh. So we were basically left stranded and awake the whole night with no idea what to do until we checked in for our replacement SQ flight at 6 am. The post-disruption management was extremely poor and fell far short of expectations, especially for an airline under the SIA group.\n\nNonetheless, one heck of an experience lor especially considering we opted for a flight back instead of a bus/train to save time but end up the whole flight journey became 12 hrs+ 😂",

There’s no railing there, but it’s the usual informal system, the unspoken rule per se: the first person stands under the sign, others queue behind.\n\nA lady arrived after me, walked past me, and stood in front of me, maybe 4 to 5 ft away. I found it odd but didn’t immediately say anything. She was on her phone, so I thought maybe she was waiting for someone. After some time, a few people were already queueing behind me\n\nWhen a taxi came, we both flagged it. I said, \"Hello, I was here first, there’s already a queue\"\n\nShe replied, “Since when?”\n\nI said, \"Since before you arrived.\" (wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt maybe she ddnt notice but I was literally standing there the whole time in a bright coloured shirt, there's no way she didn't saw me right??, I know some might think it’s a crime, but c’mon, I like my shirt hahaha.)\n\nThere was about 5 seconds of awkward silence, and even the taxi uncle gave a small beep.\n\nThen she said, \"Ok you take lah!\" in a pretty annoyed tone. I took the taxi.\n\nNow I’m wondering, AITA for insisting? In my mind I was like, \"Not my first rodeo, lady.\" 😏 A few similar instances have happened to me before, and I tend to stand my ground if the person looks around my age.\n\nI know it’s morning rush hour and everyone’s rushing to work. But at the same time, isn’t there a basic taxi stand etiquette? Also, I realized I tend to feel more intimidated if it’s older people doing this. I get scared to confront them. But if it’s someone around my age, I can stand my ground.\n\nWas I being unreasonable for speaking up? All I want to say to the people who cut queues; I hope someone calls you out on the spot!!!

No amount of $$ can buy back your limbs or life.\n\n- Field work is tough and even tougher when you are older.

And given the green transition to renewable energies, this is a mega trend which is unstoppable. Oil and gas will play a smaller role in the future. \n\n- Your enemy is not AI but the decline of this industry in Singapore. This industry has been increasingly moving to other countries and we are now very far from the heydays where Keppel was renowned as a world leader for its B class jack up rigs and the yard were packed with ever increasing orders backlog and foreign workers. These days, the yards are very quiet. \n\n\nMarine vessels are dominated by Chinese and Korean yards. Rig building and vessel conversions is steadily declining in Singapore.

Talking about low 3 for fresh grad\n\n2) Work hours - in production (hull, mech, elec, general fitting etc), officially it is 7.30am-5pm. come weekends your workers want to do OT for the extra pay or the project requires OT to meet deadline, guess who is coming back on sat/sun without OT pay? Company bus is provided, but you reach the office before 7am because the company bus has other commitments or just wants to avoid peak jam. They also do not drop you door to door, you have to get picked/dropped at designated locations.\n\n3) Work environment - dangerous, dirty, smelly. You put on the PPE and helmet with safety glasses at all times on the site. Not sure about you, but I like to be clean and sip my coffee in front of a desk rather than roughing it under the sun and breathing in barnacle shit and paint fumes and dusts.\n\n4) Work place culture - toxic like f. It is all for yourself out there. Need somebody from other dept to help with coordination? Need to beg and see their face color. Your own boss /colleagues within same dept also gatekeep their knowledge so they can remain the guru while you navigate the politics and workflow by yourself. Basically shitty singaporean work culture.\n\nSo glad I left this hellhole and never looked back. Shipyard (marine industry) is not where you should be looking to join, Maritime industry is where you should be looking at. There is a difference between the two.",

Where are your parent’s cards and cash stored? How much money in their bank account? Do you need financial aid? Approach your nearest family service centre or Social service office for assistance. \n\n2) Valuables - Where is everyone’s passports and nrics and other valuables. In the event of a fire or housebreak-in, do you know where to find them to make sure they are still there? \n\n3) Bills- Tax, Internet, Phone, Gas, Water supply and Electricity - they should have payment instructions on their website and also a phone number to call to find out if you have outstanding bills\n\n3.5) Debt and loans - Ask your parents if they owe anyone money. Are they still repaying a car or HDB loan or insurance premium? Need to figure out how to continue w monthly payments if needed. \n\n4) Communication - If your parents are working and were detained suddenly, there might be employers or concerned friends calling wondering where they might be. Be prepared for an answer acceptable to you? If your parents were known to social service before, do you know how you can reach their social workers for help?\nIf any of your parents friends or people in their drug consumption network approach u looking for them for whatever reasons- learn how to keep urself and grandma safe in case things go sideway. \n\n5) Medicine - Check if your grandma has any medicine she needs to take daily and where they are located. Can go to her GP or polyclinic to restock as they should have her records.\n\n6) HYGIENE - A house can get dirty really fast. Clean toilet and bathroom at least once a week. Do not mix bleach with toilet cleaner!!!! It will produce toxic gases. So yah I learned that the hard way the first time I cleaned my bathroom. Please for the love of everything do not anyhow mix cleaning chemicals just because they all advertise it can clean bathrooms. \nDo not let laundry pile up. Learn how to use washing machine, and iron. \n\n6.5) Food safety: Check your current food supplies and clear expired ones. Clear old food from refrigerators regularly - fresh fruit and veg can go bad in a week. check internet for food safety when cooking and food storage. Watch for mold. Usually if you dabao food don’t keep in fridge for more than two days. Try not to leave cooked food in room temperature for days. Also check if your containers can be microwaved - some cannot. No metal utensils on non-stick coating cos the surface will scratch and release toxic chemicals. Do NOT put metallic objects in a microwave unless they say its microwave safe. \n\n7) Emergency - if locked out or something leaking or spoil, save number of locksmith, 24/7 plumber, electrician, internet provider number in case got blackout. Learn where your house circuit breaker is and how it works in case power trips\n\n8) Community Support - This is a stressful time and you shouldn’t do it alone! Get help if you must! No shame ok there are more people willing to help someone whose parents are separated from them. Get to know your neighbours, religious community if any, and call your friends. They can help u with chores or getting stuff or just lending a listening ear. We are not meant to do this alone.\n\nJiayous!",

      "selftext": "Context: My girlfriend is Burmese, and like many people back home, left the country amidst the military coup and political instability. She enrolled in private diploma course in Singapore, did an internship and subsequently went on to work for the company in the F&amp;B industry. We met while I did a gig job at the shop.\n\nHer company is a small shop with a focus on selling traditional desserts, located somewhere in central Singapore. They expanded to a secondary outlet but it closed down less than a year due to poor sales. The original outlet also suffered from poor sales and the owner failed to renegotiate a new lease, resulting in a relocation to a new location, where my girlfriend is currently at. In between the lease expiry and the set-up of the new location, my girlfriend did not draw a salary for about 2 months but was held on as an employee because the boss said \"don't worry I know going back to Myanmar is very difficult now\". I was initially grateful for the gesture but things turned bad.\n\nGF has been with the shop since the beginning, and you could say I am biased but she has been really diligent. On some days even when she was unwell, she refused to be on medical leave as it would be \"bad for the company and difficult for colleagues\". She gets one off day per week, which is common for F&amp;B. What I am concerned about are her working hours.\n\nBack at the original store, her shift is 1100-2300, with a 1-hour break. When she was selected to go to the second shop, her hours became 1000-2100, similarly with a 1-hour break. At the newest location, her work hours are 0700-2000, and while there's a 1-hour break on paper, she gets about 15-20 minutes to eat at most. That works out to be more than 72 hours per week. Her boss also recently informed that they will be unable to take an off day for 2 weeks as another Malaysian colleague will be on leave. I know this is a clear violation of so many MOM regulations, and I really want to confront the management on her behalf and write in to the relevant authorities, but I am really afraid of the backlash she might receive.\n\nShe has been applying for numerous jobs but was always met with \"sorry no quota\". As a Burmese, she requires a Work Permit (NTS) which means there must be a higher corresponding number of locals in the company before a Burmese van be hired. Additionally, there is a limit to the roles she can work, such as manufacturering, F&amp;B and housekeeping.\n\nDespite being with her shop for almost 3 years, her boss seems to favour 2 new Malaysian staff that was recently hired; giving them more authority and leeway compared to my GF and her other Burmese colleague. She is really very exhausted but looking for a new job is proving an uphill task and she is afraid to voice out to the current boss lest her work permit gets cancelled. An alternative would be to apply for a job via an agent, but I have been scrawling through the postings for the past few weeks and most of them are either similarly bad or worse off. Majority of the jobs posted provide a median salary of $1500 with either 1 or 2 off day the entire month. This is excluding a hefty agent fee of about $6000. Not sure how they exploit certain loopholes when it is clearly listed that workers on a WP should be paid a minimum wage of $2000.\n\nThank you for reading and any advice is greatly appreciated.",

I have volunteered with the Myanmar community and exploitation of Myanmar workers is more common because unlike workers from other countries, going home is not a real option for them. They have accrued massive debt just to get out and they risk not being able to get another passport, etc. This is why when they have to change jobs, they go to Thailand or Indonesia rather than go back to Myanmar. \n\n3. The problem is that any MOM investigation may lead to her wrongful termination. And yes, if she is fired, she is going to have to challenge that it was wrongful. This will cost money. In the mean time, she has no income, place to stay or even a valid permit to stay in the country. \n\n4. Even if she is not deemed to be a whistleblower, the risk of termination purely based on lack of money is real. \n\n5. OP  - at this point, you are aware of the harsh reality that she is in and the options are very limited. But your concerns are very real that she will work herself to death at this rate. Frankly, so many in Myanmar were eager to get out and agents exploit this with high fees and then leave them in terrible work situations. And Singapore sounds better for them compared to Malaysian and Thailand (also lots of Myanmar folks there) but we also have work conditions like this. \n\n6. Options I can see. \n\nA. Give feedback (through her and her colleagues), to the bosses that they cannot tahan. Yes, there is a risk but if the owner is smart, they also know they cannot work them to the bone. It is possible they continue with the conditions because they genuinely think that Myanmar people don't mind. \n\nB. Threat of escalation (through her or yourself) to MOM. This is a gamble, since it can definitely lead to retaliation. In this case, both need to be ready for work place retaliation as well as unjust firing. You may need to set aside funds/accom while she fights the case. \n\nC. Quit. Commit to finding another job in sg or overseas. This comes with a real risk of long term separation. \n\nD. Commit to marriage early. We should not take marriage lightly at all but if both of you are really sure that you want to be with each other, then it does ease a lot of the problems that you had on your mind. \n\n  \nGood luck bro.

Speaking to my boss has given me lots of negative emotions (I hesitate to use the words toxic or trauma because we live in a time where these words get thrown around too harshly). \n\nHere's a list of some of the things boss would expect (just the top hits) :   \n\\- no complaints to work on weekends (no pay, no overtime)   \n\\- full responsibility for outcomes which she expects, while failing to communicate clearly   \n\\- for me to attend a meeting not even 2 hours after i had shared a loved one had passed on  \n\\- for me to travel to her home to personaly deliver tape for her to measure items in her new home   \n\\- for me to prepare a website for her son's university application based on work that I had done, but she had attributed to him as a \"co-founder\"   \n\\- given that i was the single hire to manage so much of the work, i had requested for a strongly worded letter of recommendation whcih i had drafted to which she had shared that many of the groundbreaking work which i had done (and indicated in the letter) were the skills of an entrepreneur which i clearly was not   \n\\- instead, she made it seem that i was \"very good at talking\", trying to diminish all the work i'd done to build the organisation in the past year and make it that i have the gift of the gab as i have chosen to shift to teaching. \n\nI feel like I am still reeling and hurt from these awful comments. \n\nDespite leaving such a place where i have had less than positive experiences, I'm really struggling to feel excited that it is over or that I no longer am affiliated with such an awful place, I am truly numb. I find myself unable to truly relax, or to be \"happy\" that I have left. Instead I still have some flashbacks of my time working at this organisation and I realise I do need to take some sort of a \"break\" before I commence my new role.

Nature is a lot more varied and very accessible but that’s geography dependent.\n\nAlso, it’s hard to get used to the taxes here… filing was so much easier and less financially painful in SG, but I guess you pay for it in other ways. Also gives you an appreciation of SG’s digital conveniences—FAST transfers, medical forms (filled out at least ten pages of paper forms here).\n\nOverall it has been better for us, just trade offs",

However, Grab didn’t make much sense to me as a mere 5 minute drive could cost between RM10-12. As we’re earning RM, you can imagine it as $12 for 5 mins drive. If you’re wondering “why not just walk lah”, I’m sorry, pedestrian infrastructure are virtually nonexistent here 😆 it’s unsafe at some parts of town and there are almost no proper sidewalks to walk on 🥲Touristy places like KSL or Eco Botanic are not like the local neighbourhoods of JB. \n\nBecause of this, I started to stay home more, and my lifestyle slowly changed. I was less active, I think my step counter reduced from 8k in SG to less than 2k in JB per day 🥲 I really (and still) miss the ease of walking in SG v much! \n\nMany Singaporeans think that living in JB/Malaysia is cheap. But most do not realize that the salary earned in Malaysia are actually the same in SG. A uni grad in SG may get a starting salary of $4k, but in JB, the same job may get you RM3.5k only. For the same $ you pay in RM, the quality you receive may also not be the same as what you get. For instance, $1.5k can get you an iPhone 17, but at RM1.5k? Settle for Realme please. (No shade to Realme though!) I truly feel the difference in life quality ever since moving to JB. Even though we earn a decent amount from our business, it’s still a difficult pill to swallow to have to pay RM7 for eggs 😅 \n\nThat saying, I don’t regret moving to JB and will probably make the same decision if given an opportunity again!",

Over the last two years, I had already been traveling frequently—about 40 days per year—under my previous company’s work-from-anywhere (WFA) policy, which allowed me to test different locations across Southeast Asia. So far, I’ve spent time in various parts of Thailand, Vietnam, and most recently Cambodia.\n\nAfter being retrenched last year, I started working on my own startup, which currently earns around SGD 3,000 per month. In many Southeast Asian countries, that income allows for a relatively comfortable lifestyle.\n\nI am currently based in Cambodia and have been living here for about two months. Although Cambodia sometimes has a negative reputation due to scams or safety concerns, I’ve personally found the quality of life here to be quite decent—especially compared to Singapore. The visa process is also significantly easier than in countries like Thailand or Vietnam.\n\nIn Phnom Penh, a one-bedroom apartment with a pool and gym typically costs around SGD 700 per month, excluding utilities. Food expenses average about SGD 20–30 per day if I dine at cafés or restaurants, and can drop to around SGD 10 per day if I eat local meals.\n\nOverall, my monthly expenses are usually around SGD 2,000 if I live normally, and could be optimized further by shopping more locally. Recently, my spending went above SGD 3,000 because I’ve been exploring—visiting places like Siem Reap and Kampot, and occasionally enjoying nightlife. I’ve intentionally given myself about a year of financial runway to experiment with this lifestyle.\n\nLike you, I don’t prioritize material comfort as much as experiences. I enjoy exploring new places, nature, cafés, beaches, and different cultures. I’m also currently learning how to ride a motorbike so I can explore more independently.\n\nMy favorite places so far have been Koh Samui in Thailand and Da Nang in Vietnam. Next, I’m planning to explore Cebu City for its beaches and nightlife.\n\nUltimately, the decision is very personal. There are many countries where you can live affordably due to currency differences. I highly recommend doing a trial stay before committing long-term—living somewhere as a tourist is very different from actually living there day-to-day.\n\nHope this helps, and I’m happy to chat with anyone who’s interested in exploring this path.\n\n",

      "selftext": "So I was thinking about this today. As a middle aged, mid income citizen, cost of living pressures, job security, healthcare costs and care of elderly parents are real pressures. \n\nEach of these are pressure points that I feel would make me want to reconsider having children. \n\nMy parents were middle class citizens. With two working adults, they were able to afford a house and pay it off in 15 years, a car that cost about a year’s salary, and a helper. \n\nTheir parents were in their late 50s and retired when we were born which facilitated childcare arrangements. \n\nHolidays were simple affairs, mostly Malaysia and Indonesia. Only when we became teenagers did more exotic destinations like Thailand, China and Japan come into the picture. Europe and US were O-Level, A-Level grad presents. \n\nLife seemed simpler but more manageable. You bought assets, be it stocks or property, its value visibly increased over time. You could upgrade properties inline with wage growth or own a second one as rental income.\n\nLife today feels worse off, there’s no job security, asset appreciation is outpacing wage growth, even as middle income adults keeping up with cost pressures is a real challenge. \n\nThis is not a criticism of Singapore as I think we are an amazing country. I also observe the same in many other first world cities. \n\nHence I question the need to have kids in such an environment and would like to hear the thoughts of others. For those who have or who intend to have kids, can you share what gives you the confidence and strength to know you won’t mess up and can be a successful parent? ",

It feels more like a combination of multiple factors, which eventually means you will have to handle everything on your own anyhow, especially in the middle-class. What this means is that the money pressure is definitely there, since SG is a developed nation and to maintain that attractiveness, things do get expensive with our tiny piece of land. Even more so when you have growing mouths to feed, and aging mouths to take care of. \n\nBut the crux seems to be that we are now more concerned about the future of our children, and directly picking up that pressure. It is not that people are getting more selfish, self-centered and wanting to enjoy life for themselves. It is rather how do we see a brighter future where kids will flourish, how can we provide, compared to those expat children who have a lot more resources, and a home back in their country where they can go back to in case things do not work out. Our parents are in the era where hard work pays off, and they somehow have the belief that their kids will make it. It is seldom the case now. Those who have kids, are really those who love having kids, and will find ways to make it work (of course lets not consider the accidents :p) \n\nHow could it be more palatable for locals? As cost of living is always on the rise, could we have adopted the 'flexibility' for locals to perhaps own 2 properties, to stay and to rent out for growing number of foreigners, so Singaporeans can have additional income and asset? Could this help prevent casual marriages for the sake of BTOs and housing? Could we have adopted better tax benefits that help care for our seniors instead of just taxing the working class and expanding MRT lines? Or could we have better job protection to stop companies from doing layoffs for the sake of their books? \n\nUltimately there are too many considerations, and would say that if you really want to have kids, just go with it. You can never predict the future, so there is no point in trying to logic it out because you will just end up not having it. ",

      "selftext": "I’m a teen working part time at a restaurant. Before working, I have been struggling with stuttering and my memory. I can easily blank out completely and forget a conversation just that happened just a while ago (though I think is pretty common). Nontheless I thought a fast paced environment would help me to overcome these issues that I have been (still am) facing.\n\nI’ve been working for almost to 4 months, so there are certain expectations that people have of me.\n\nYesterday however, I was working a full shift. In the afternoon, I was not in the right state of mind. It was very heavy and hazy. This subsequently  affected my performance at night, despite me stationed at a position I’m very familiar with. I was so slow, pacing back and forth, and did many things wrongly. This was very unusual of me, even my coworkers realised. One of them asked me if I was okay since I seemed very stressed and not knowing what to do. At that point in time, I knew I messed up shitloads. But I still had to keep going.\n\nThat was when I was super unlucky. I accidentally cut myself with a staple bullet. I didn’t know the cut was deeper than a usual paper cut until blood started leaking on the receipts I touched. I was shocked. Those receipts were meant to be given to the customers. Thankfully though, those customers didn’t want a receipt from the start so I could keep the extra clean spare one. The problem though was that it didn’t stop bleeding for 10-15 minutes, and there were still a long line of customers who wanted to pay.\n\nBeing a cashier, you’d have to wipe the tables after helping customers to pay. Unluckily the two tables I had to wipe had pools of water customers accidentally spilled, which would take me much more time to clean. Moreover more and more customers wanted to pay, so I had to stop what I was doing and go back to the cashier.\n\nMy breaking point was when a guy ordered takeaway. He basically wanted to order a bottle of wine, but restaurant policy states that takeaway orders for wine would require customers to buy something else with it. I told him and he said he will consider. He came back and I double checked with him “So you want the red wine? A whole bottle?”, then he said, in a tone I’m not sure condescending “You mean we can order a glass of wine for takeaway”. This made me think about that one time I actually made this mistake when I was still new, so my voice just cracked and I started breaking down.\n\nLater on after closing, the same colleague asked me the same question, whether I was okay since tonight was extremely messy. This happened infront of two other colleagues. I didn’t mean to break down in front of them. I really didn’t. However, I kept thinking about my incompetence at work, how even after 4 months I couldn’t be as quick as my colleagues, and that I kept stammering. Coupled with flashbacks when my mother scolded me for being useless, incapable, and that she ultimately raised a pig. (She said this more than once). Moreover, when I’m stressed, I sometimes hear voices calling me, which makes me go crazy since sometimes I’ll walk up to customers asking if they needed anything, and my colleagues will see it as I’m walking back and forth. At that point, I just couldn’t take it anymore. I was incompetent to say the least. I was problematic and practically a burden. I wish I had the authority to deny, but looking at what’d I done, having my colleagues to resolve so many of my mistakes yesterday night, overwhelmed me with guilt.",

      "selftext": "from Sam Choo:\n\n“I felt like walking into a different country.”\n\nA few years before Covid, a minister shared that when he stepped into a lift, he heard people around him speaking in a language not his own. He said it was the first time he felt like a foreigner in his own country.\n\nBack then, I was working in the same area, serving one of the big banks. Every morning I would walk past a department with glass walls. One day I glanced in. Row after row of desks. Computer screens glowing. And every single person inside seemed to be from the same foreign country. It's like a foreign village planted into the room. \n\n \n\nYesterday, I read a post from a fellow Singaporean working in an office in the West. He said most of his colleagues were foreigners. They had their own lingo, their own inside jokes, their own favorite lunch spots. He found himself listening to conversations he could not quite follow. Smiling when everyone laughed, even when he did not fully get the joke. He said he felt like a minority in his own turf.\n\n \n\nWhen you sit in your own office and feel like the outsider, something shifts quietly inside your identity.  It is just a subtle dislocation. Like the furniture in your house has been rearranged and you are still trying to find the light switch in the dark.\n\nLast night, after dinner, I walked into the mall nearby. I had not been there since Covid. Same building. Same escalators. But it felt unfamiliar. Many of the shop signs were brands from one particular foreign country. I caught myself wondering where the local brands had gone.\n\nAnother day, my wife and I visited a neighborhood shop. The cashier could not speak English. We stumbled through the transaction. It was awkward.\n\nIn your workplace, do you ever feel like a guest in your own country?\n\nSome of us carry a quiet ache that is hard to explain. It is not about hating anyone. It is not about rejecting change. It is simply the feeling of being slightly displaced in a place you once knew so well.\n\nWe start asking ourselves, softly: Is this still my home?\n\nOr am I slowly becoming a minority in my own land?\n\nIt is a strange feeling to have.\n\nMaybe all I am really saying is this.\n\nI just want to feel at home.",

My workplace, colleagues are mostly foreigners. It’s really sad. \n\nThere is a genuine lack of belonging and they destroyed the 40-50 years of nation building identity in less than a decade. \n\nRecently, the kpop vs SEA drama got me thinking. Singapore was left over as SEAbling. I guess it’s very real. What is Singapore and who are Singaporeans? That unique identity once proud is now eroded. Most Singaporeans are naturalized citizens (data not publicly given). Those pumping RON95 and giving a bad rep? PR/converts. SEA don’t really care what a Singaporean is because we don’t have an identify. We have Vietnamese, Malaysians, Filipinos, Indonesians all living here. Sg-Chinese? Sg-Malay? Sg-Indian? It’s not relevant anymore. \n\nSo what is a Singaporean exactly? Just a citizenship on paper and a passport I guess. Those left behind are neither Chinese nor Singaporean since we can’t exactly pin point what’s that. \n\nOur heritage? All artificially kept alive on life support. Just look at NDP and all the nostalgia stuff are very out of touch. Dragon playground? Gone a damn long time ago no one I talk to around me knows about sand playground. 5 stones? No one I talk to knows the game. PCK and under one roof nostalgia play? Just cringe (government gave them so much heat for creative expression our sitcom scene died with just a few hits). But now? Milk for nostalgia. \n\nI envy my SG-Malay friends. The culture is at least protected to some extent. They are minority but not withstanding the effect of PRC or India migrant culture erosion. I love speaking to them. They are the last group I can 100% interact with and know they understand what I’m talking about at least a good 80% in spirit, in nostalgia and in mindset.",

The part that really killed me was when he said he only plucked up the courage to say something now because I recently broke up with my ex. He said he hated seeing another guy hurt me and it broke his heart to see me cry over someone who didn't appreciate me. He’s been holding this in for years because he didn't want to ruin our friendship, but he couldn't keep it inside anymore.\n\nGuys, I’m so lost. I’ve always treated him as a good friend only. I felt so guilty looking at his face because he looked so hopeful and vulnerable. I didn't want to reject him on Valentine's Day of all days, so I said I needed time to think. Now I feel so guilty. Did I lead him on by being so close to him? I really don't want to lose him because he's my pillar of support, but I also don't want to give him false hope.

(theres a lot more to the leading on, obviously but im putting a generic one cos i dont know him or what makes him feel loved)\n\n2. remove the guilt. you have none. to put it simply: its his business he fell in love with you. not your business. sounds wierd and counter-intuitive, i know. \n\n3. really consider it. whether you CAN be with him or not. hes likely a good guy. he doesnt push boundaries as you can see when you were seeing someone else. thats a big green flag.\n\n4. if you cannot, just tell him straight up that you cant be with him. dont cushion the blow by saying something trite. he's a big boy and this is something that'll be good for him. (learning to deal with heartbreak, pain helps people grow, that said dont be unnecessarily cruel by flaunting future boyfriends in his face.)\n\n5. put on your big girl pants and act normally with him if you do reject him, we can tell when the woman in our lives is acting differently or wierdly. the awkwardness will come from you when you're always watching for signs of distress. remember men and women react differently. women instinctively avoid pain. men(grown ones anyway) have to embrace it cos it helps us grow. this one is important. act with him like your friend...or boyfriend if you say yes. \n\n6. whether the r/s will be the same? it likely wont be with the understandings and knowledge now in the open. but you can still be friends, just with readjusted interactions. (no staying same room, hanging out late alone, drinking heavily alone, that sort of thing, **no chance for emotions to spiral**. Yes, i had close friends growing up who liked me who I didnt like. We were CLOSE. She confessed and I had to shut it down. And i've also conversely had girls i liked who i confessed to but didnt like me back. It got shut down and things changed, not super badly or awkwardly, we just had to be adults about it.)\n\n7. false hope is you saying \"MAYBE\". and in relationships, if it aint YES, its NO. which is why i said...really consider it.\n\n  \nBe well.

Singaporeans were a massive **82%** majority, meaning almost everyone shared a permanent, lifelong stake in the nation. The streets were quieter and the social fabric was uniform, as the non-resident workforce was just beginning to expand. Back then, the country functioned as a tight-knit nation-state where the vast majority of people held voting rights and a multi-generational claim to the land.\n\nIn **2026**, the population has surged to **6.15 million**, yet the citizen share has shrunk to just **59%**. While the total population grew by **68%**, the non-resident group exploded by over **530%**, reaching nearly **2 million**. This demographic shift has transformed the island into a high-pressure global hub where citizens of the country are increasingly outnumbered by transient residents. The physical density is compounded by an ageing crisis, with **21%** of citizens now **over 65**, leaving a smaller core of local stakeholders to navigate an unrecognisably crowded city.\n\nCrucially, the **59%** citizen figure is **deceptive** because it ignores the distinction between natural-born and naturalised citizens. The data masks the influx of adults who may not share the local culture or have served National Service (for males). This internal shift means the proportion of \"traditional\" stakeholders with deep roots is even lower than official stats suggest. Today, the [native-born](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/native-born) Singaporean finds themselves in a city where nearly **1 in 3 people** is a temporary guest, fundamentally altering the sense of home that existed thirty years ago.\n\n_________\n**Tl;DR:** Since **1996**, Singapore's population has hit close to **6.2 million** while the citizen stake diluted from **82% to 59%**. This **59%** includes many new citizens who didn't grow up locally or serve NS, meaning traditional stakeholders now share a much denser country with **2 million** non-residents.

I deduce from the aftermath photos that the collision point likely occured as the victims were trying to get across the carpark entrance. There is also a STOP sign at the end of the pedestrain path, which the driver will clearly be able to see, unless the driver is using her phone of course.\n\nPersonally I've parked at that carpark several times and common sense tells me to drive extra slowly whenever I exit as that area has high pedrestrain traffic due to it being a tourist site and near proximity to Maxwell MRT Exit 1. So I don't see how it can be argued that the driver was not at fault. Knowing SG lenient road laws I lack the faith to believe there'll be any justice for the victims.",

These names are based on hard to compile sources (word of mouth, forums, Telegram, Lemon8, etc). The aim is to share information so that others can do their own due diligence before committing. Along with the names, I'll try my best to include links to where the discussions took place so you can verify yourself. These are rarely available depending on where it was sourced from.\n\nNote: some of these experiences were with certain individual IDs within these firms, so you may still have a good experience if you engage the right person. There’s also the possibility that IDs move between firms, so please always do your own diligence. However, if you’ve had experiences where the workmanship itself was poor, do mention it - as that usually points to the contractors used by the firm as a whole, not just the individual ID.\n\nIf you are an ID/contractor reading this, please note this list reflects individual experiences and feedback - not absolute fact - and I encourage homeowners to always research further.\n\nHere’s the current list (please add on if you’ve come across others or PM me directly):\n\n1.

That way homeowners can better assess (since it’s very probable that reviews of the mothership would apply to the subsidiary/split firm). Also note that even though this post has been made some time ago, I update it frequently whenever I find more or ppl reach out.",

I'm glad it resurfaced again. I have had encounter few companies that just blatantly block if you contact them about their poor job done, swinging warranty that never gets honoured, plenty google review raised but these companies can always buy Google review to bury those.\n\nAlso plenty \"ahbengs\" set up these companies with little to no experience (esp nowadays with AI) , since they're essentially just concierge of contacting all other contractor. Please avoid those and all the heavily sponsored companies, don't just look at those suspiciously high reviews, scrutinise their lowest one too.\n\nOP pls open subreddit on renotalkSG.

Locally born Singaporeans’ jobs have been affected. Many of the immigrants have also been granted PRs and citizenship without clear justification.\n\nThe unhappiness with immigrants is a natural reaction. It’s also displayed in Japan, Europe, Australia and Canada.\n\nI don’t think the general Singaporean is racist. Stop calling them that. This isn’t purely racism.\n\nYou cannot deny the general population’s anger when many people of different nationalities with fake degrees and bad cultural practices come over to take away jobs. You probably don’t feel it because you are retired.\n\nIt seems to me also that you don’t drive at all. It’s baffling how strong the impact of the car could be at that small road unless the driver was speeding and driving recklessly. You mean people are not supposed to feel angry about this?\n\nAnd go read the article carefully again: After knocking down the hapless child, her car moved again and rolled over the abdomen of her mother. Was it twice?\n\nWho drives like this?\n\nOh Bertha, you are saying people shouldn’t feel angry? You are such an angel hor. No apologies here, but we are humans here with emotions. We can’t fake it.\n\nAnd looking at the many photos, you mean you cannot interpret from the driver’s stance that she was not remorseful at all? Who the f would stand and gesticulate after fatally knocking down a young pedestrian and using the car to roll over the abdomen of her mother?!!\n\nOh oh… this was supposed to be merely an accident and that we should all calm down. Don’t get mad. It’s an honest human mistake. Doesn’t matter who is driving the car.\n\nGoodness. We don’t need a moral police here. You could have pivoted  your POV in a better way than try to reprimand people who trashed the driver.”",

Locally born Singaporeans’ jobs have been affected. Many of the immigrants have also been granted PRs and citizenship without clear justification.\n\nThe unhappiness with immigrants is a natural reaction. It’s also displayed in Japan, Europe, Australia and Canada.\n\nI don’t think the general Singaporean is racist. Stop calling them that. This isn’t purely racism.\n\nYou cannot deny the general population’s anger when many people of different nationalities with fake degrees and bad cultural practices come over to take away jobs. You probably don’t feel it because you are retired.\n\nIt seems to me also that you don’t drive at all. It’s baffling how strong the impact of the car could be at that small road unless the driver was speeding and driving recklessly. You mean people are not supposed to feel angry about this?\n\nAnd go read the article carefully again: After knocking down the hapless child, her car moved again and rolled over the abdomen of her mother. Was it twice?\n\nWho drives like this?\n\nOh Bertha, you are saying people shouldn’t feel angry? You are such an angel hor. No apologies here, but we are humans here with emotions. We can’t fake it.\n\nAnd looking at the many photos, you mean you cannot interpret from the driver’s stance that she was not remorseful at all? Who the f would stand and gesticulate after fatally knocking down a young pedestrian and using the car to roll over the abdomen of her mother?!!\n\nOh oh… this was supposed to be merely an accident and that we should all calm down. Don’t get mad. It’s an honest human mistake. Doesn’t matter who is driving the car.\n\nGoodness. We don’t need a moral police here.

The person said they offer free certifications and personality assessments, and mentioned exposure to financial consulting and client work.  Apparently graduates with no experience in the sector are welcomed too\n\nHowever, before the second round interview, they asked me to fill in a Google Form requesting quite personal financial details, including:\n\n\t•\tmonthly income / allowance\n\n\t•\tmonthly expenses\n\n\t•\ttotal savings\n\n\t•\tinvestment portfolio details\n\n\t•\twhether I have insurance\n\n\t•\tCPF balances\n\nThey also mentioned:\n\n\t•\tcertifications sponsorship\n\n\t•\tpersonality profiling\n\n\t•\tface-to-face meetings\n\n\t•\tpossible overseas exposure\n\nIt’s under an individual campaign name (“Lei On Me”) by a financial advisor (name given: Shi Lei Ho), not directly through a big company HR portal.\n\nHas anyone encountered similar programmes? Is this typically FA/insurance agent recruitment rather than a standard internship? IMO it already sounds like a MLM, or just an FA recruitment trap, but i wanna get some opinions, who knows, i do want to broaden my opportunities, just not sure if this is the way to go.\n\nI don’t have the ad link i applied to, but just provided a few of the questions i was asked to fill out \n\nWould appreciate any experiences or advice — thank you.",

Basically, I find that a lot of Singaporeans like to chase dividends in funds, sometimes to an irrational level. \n\nBasically how a fund would is the money from all the investors are pulled to buy shares. This allow investors to gain broad exposure to investments, some that they do not have direct access to. Other than ETFs which trade on the market, it should be noted that the fund price that you regularly see is based on the fund's investment portfolio, along with operational cash-equivalent entries (cash, receivables, payables). ETF are also priced this way, but because it's traded on a board, the trading price may move from the calculated price, but generally not to a big degree.\n\nNow, back to dividends. When a fund pays dividends, it is from a fund's assets. It will pay from it's cash, and if that is insufficient, it will sell some stocks to make up the difference. The corresponding effect is that a fund price will always fall after paying out the dividend, unless its portfolio movement makes up the difference.\n\nStocks are paid at investor's perceived value of the company and expected future cashflows. Dividends paid from stocks can have a positive impact on the perceived value and increase the stock price even when stocks pay out dividends. This does not happen with funds. Funds pay out dividends from assets that are already yours. You don't magically gain any value from dividends other than cashflow, which could be a valid reason to wanting dividends from some people.\n\nNow, something that even fewer people knows about. Dividends cost money to the fund. Fund administrators (the ones doing the operational work for the fund managers) typically charge a fee for each transaction to the fund. This includes dividends. And note that this is for each transaction. That means a flat fee is typically charged for each dividend transaction paid to each receiving investor. Typically, you are paying a small amount for each dividend you received. \n\nSo there you have it. Hope this post helps people understand the underlying mechanics a bit better and make wiser decisions.\n\n",

Small dividends is sth nice to look forward to as well.\n\n Can trim and decide your %allocation based on your preference periodically. You might find there is no need to add to your US holdings since it keeps out growing the allocation. But if you're DCAing it might be too much work to keep checking and following the news, I don't wanna be so actively trading in fear of doing dumb things\n\nDuepromograte explains it very well. The gains should out weight the depreciation, as US equities tend to go up if USD devalues. Compared to the flat line SGX if you pick say the last ten years other than the the recent two years and compare the Snp for the same period. Devalued USD also means you're buying more units so if you DCA I guess it would sort itself out. Just don't beileve your x% gain in USD so much. Technically it only matters when you cash out and convert back to SGD. \n\nInvesting the same sum 10y ago in SGX even with dividend might not return you the same even after accounting for usd depreciation. I guess depends are you in the growth / accumarion phase or moving on to drawing for retirement. \n\nI'm more curious how old timers that started when USD was 1+8 - 2ish returns are affected or they have taken profit and rotated to SGX as they age for dividends",

A somewhat deflationary mindset is beginning to set in -- no 'urgency' to consume now since inflation remains very low, and intense competition plus over-production from excess capacity means prices continue falling over time. This is why some are cautioning that China may fall into a similar deflationary spiral like Japan in the 90s, if more is not done to reform the economy.\n\nThere are also signs that China is experiencing a \"liquidity trap\". 30-year bond yields are ~2.2%, but credit impulse has not picked up meaningfully. Cuts to the RRR (reserve req ratio) unleashing liquidity into the financial system have not been meaningfully stimulatory.\n\nStock market-wise, it is quite clear policymakers are trying to engineer a gradual market rally, whilst trying to boost household participation in stocks in hopes of spurring consumption through the wealth effect. The \"National Team\" has been selling stocks so far this year (they were big buyers in 2024 to support the market). For Hong Kong-listed equities, daily southbound net buying through the StockConnect has materially slowed, and certainly days are actually seeing outflows. More importantly, earnings have not materially grown y/y at the index level, so last year's rally was mostly driven by valuation multiple expansion.\n\nGiven current circumstances, it seems that a slow grind higher in Chinese stocks is the most likely outcome for this year, barring a trade war re-escalation. We may come to a point where \"bad is good\" -- poor data forces policymakers to rollout more stimulus, that should ultimately benefit the stock market. Also quite unlikely that Chinese stocks catch up to their East Asian breathren given the absence of the AI thematic (Korea/Taiwan) or broad fiscal stimulus (Japan).",

For example, you could save money and eat the absolute bare minimum for food, but that itself is not a good diet and instead you are killing yourself faster by eating poorly. Would it not make sense to buy healthier, organic food that taste just as good but fuels your body properly? \n\nYou can eat dory fish which is just solid fishy water with little nutrients or you can buy fishes like salmon, cod or herring or mackerel which is healthier and taste better but it cost more. In that situation, the dollar value of spending more far outweighs the dollar value of saving because the dollar value you save doesn't pay for the lost in health. You enjoy food more because the food is nicer and these are the situations where lifestyle inflation makes sense. \n\nThis can be applied to everything, the goal isn't to spend more for the sake of spending more. The goal is to optimise the dollar value spent to benefit you the most. Look at the things you have in your life, it is sometimes worth asking, what is best possible version of the thing you can have? \n\nAnother example, I have is pants. Many people here will end up buying uniqlo pants because it's cheap and looks okay. But uniqlo is fast fashion, a pair of jogger i brought would pill and rip within the year because the material is so bad. That led me down the rabbit hole of pants, from dickies work wear carpenter pants to raw denim jeans. (I was into raw denim before raw denim was a trend) this has led me to spending hundreds into a single pair of jeans and hundreds more into extremely high quality pants. With all the pants I brought, i am set for the next 10 years. They will last me longer than any uniqlo pants could.",

Not a significant duration IMO\n- services are cheaper, probably due to cheaper rent( e.g. beauty salons, nails, home based services, gyms, etc) \n- overall: easy access to day to day amenities, affordable food options \n\nCentral (Stevens area)\n- easy to get to CBD within 20-30 minutes \n- minimal food options (you either have to cook, or travel out to buy food. Aka no coffeeshop nearby to get your quick meal fix) \n- lack of a big enough supermarket to do your groceries run (groceries run have to be more deliberate, either a planned weekly trip, since the nearby Marts are pretty small and may not have wide selections)\n- overall: good area if you want to get to CBD quickly. Good connectivity to major expressway \n(Do not that expenses may be higher since food / groceries options are either finest, Cold Storage, Orchard Road cafe/ food courts, unless you make a deliberate trip out to neighbourhood area (e.g, TPY) \n\nI would say taking a walk around your intended place of stay will be ideal.
