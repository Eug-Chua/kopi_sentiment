      "selftext": "TLDR: Very poor management by the parties involved, Scoot and the Airport, from scheduled takeoff to actual arrival took 12hours+\nsome ppl (including elderlies and ppl on crutches) only received food 9 hours later and went without sleep throughout the entire ordeal, did not receive on ground transport and hotel contrary to Scoot's statement. \n\n\nI was unfortunately on flight TR 497 from KL to SG which Scoot said: \"affected customers were provided with accommodation, refreshments and on-ground transport.\" Over here https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/scoot-flight-from-kuala-lumpur-on-feb-9-cancelled-after-technical-fault-detected\n\n\nSurprised to read about the Refreshment and passengers being sent to hotel to rest, as quite a few of us had a totally different experience, went about 9 hours without food or rest.\n\nTill today, we have not heard directly from Scoot (although we booked through trip.com who reached out to us so wondering if Scoot only communicated with passengers who booked directly).\n\nWhile I can understand the technical issues was unexpected, Scoot's handling of the cancellation was extremely disappointing, there was lack of communication, clarity and proper process. \n\nWe only managed to get our boarding pass about 9 hours later, after much detours and abrupt changes, without sleep or food (even though Scoot mentioned providing Refreshments, it seemed like most passengers did not received it). Only arrived back in Singapore at around 12pm the following day, which meant the need to apply for leave from work.\n\nNevertheless, it was an interesting experience, we quickly became friends with strangers, including an elderly Korean lady who was travelling alone and anxious. When we finally boarded the next flight back 12 hours later, we saw many fellow passengers  who bonded and helped each other through the arduous 12 hours, taking pictures and biding farewell even though they did not speak the same language.\n\n\n-Sat on the runway for about an hour before the crew finally informed us of the issue\n\n-Only offered plain water at 12am. When we requested for snacks, after a 2 hours delay into a supposedly 1 hour flight, the crew informed us we had to purchase in flight meals\n\n-There was another airplane stuck behind us for about 3 hours since our flight was blocking access to the takeoff runway, it was eventually towed away\n\n-Could feel the Captain was empathetic which is appreciated, however, there were multiple occasions when they didnt update us for up to an hour even though they announced they would in 20 mins etc\n\n-Once we arrived back at the terminal, the nightmare continued, total chaos and lack of clarity + communication \n\n-There was a long queue to enter the only lift which would bring us inside  the airport, once we exited the lift we were told to head to counter P9\n\n-After queuing for a long time to enter P9, the other passengers in front of us suddenly turned around and walked towards the opposite direction, the staff did not communicate anything, we only found out through word of mouth from other passengers that P9 was for passengers who would like to cancel and get a refund.\n\n-It seemed like Refreshments were being distributed at P9 so we ended up with zero Refreshment as we had to follow the queue of ppl walking in the opposite direction if we're would like to take the next earliest flight by SIA.\n\n-Again, through word of mouth, at around 2 or 3 am, we were told that we would be heading to sunway pyramid hotel which was about an hour away, this created a lot of unrest among the weary passengers (many haven't eaten or rest since 10pm). It didnt make sense to travel to the hotel, spend proably an hour or two, or maybe even lesser accounting for potential traffic jam,  waiting time to check in hundreds of passengers,before travelling another hour back to the airport as we heard the earliest flight was around 9/10am (checked with the staff if we could opt for a later flight to get some rest if we were to go to the hotel but they seemed as lost as we were). At this point there was a queue of a few hundred passengers waiting to exit the immigration which would take some time too\n\n-When we finally exited immigration, a lot of us lost sight of the staff and did not know where to board the bus to the hotel, some passengers who did not speak English were very anxious\n\n-We ended up making friends with other passengers to share info and figure things out, \"adopting\" an elderly Korean who was travelling alone and spoke no English as she looked anxious\n\n-since we lost sight of the staff, about a hundred of us gathered at Scoot's terminal, which was unfortunately not opened yet\n\n-after some time a staff finally came to Scott's counter and told us to follow her to board the bus to the hotel\n\n-while waiting (what seems like an hour) for the bus,  at about 5am the staff told us we will not be travelling to the hotel anymore,  but head to the next terminal to board the 10am flight to Singapore\n\n-the airport shuttle bus which is used by the public to the terminal was full which led to even more waiting\n\n-once we boarded the bus, we were surprised to see the staff not onboard,  we were expected to make our own way, some passengers alighted at the wrong stop and we had to help inform them\n\n-finally reached SIA terminal at about 6am and got our boarding pass, close to 9 hours since the scheduled takeoff and about 6 hours since we disembarked from the plane\n\n-the staff at the counter seemed unaware about the flight cancellation and was surprised to hear our flight was supposed to take off 10 hours ago\n\n-we were finally issued 35RM meal voucher, proceed to have our first meal in 10 hours with our newfound friends and the elderly Korean passenger\n\n-quite a few of us had difficulty entering the departure hall as the Malaysian immigration doesn't seem to be aware of the flight cancellation, some ended up spending more than an hour after being sent on a wild goose chase by the immigration officers who did not knew how to handle passengers from the cancelled flight\n\nOverall a very tiring but interesting experience\n\n\nEdit\n1. We didnt really had time to get food as the staff told us to follow them, from the moment we dismebarked to the moment we were reissued a new boarding pass, it was endless waiting and queueing at immigration, bus stop etc as you can read from above. If u wandered off the get food you might get left behind. It would have been a different story if there was clear communication as to where to reschedule our flights as opposed to asking a few hundred ppl to follow them without much info.\n\n2. The point of this post is to highlight how the process was extremely disorganised and disappointing. Funny to see some snarky and strange comments focusing on 3rd party booking lol. From what we saw, Passengers who booked direct + 3rd party went through the same process and got the same treatment. They were so disorganised I doubt they even knew who booked direct and who booked through 3rd party.\n\n3. I am not sure how flight cancellation is typically handled, but yes it seems like it wasn't solely Scoot which mismanaged. We suspect tue staff who spoke to us were from KLIA, so we proably had zero contact with anyone from Scoot.\n\n4. While it was an incredibly fustrating and anxious experience, a minor few were condescending in their interaction with the staff, which was pretty ugly. At the end of the day, everyone is just trying their best, the staff looked as lost as we were, they dont make the SOPs and seemed to be poorly trained, which isnt their fault. They are just junior employees who probably have zero decision making powers, not right to act out on them.\n\n5.  Most ppl were kind and helpful; kindness cuts across language barriers and nationality, strangers turned into friends who looked out for one another since we had no one else to rely upon.",

The technical fault and wait onboard the aircraft itself wasn’t the issue, it was unforseen and that's completely understandable.\n\nThe real problem was everything after i.e. the ground management which was damn jialat. Ground handling was chaotic with no clear communication, no directions, and no proper coordination. \n\nContrary to what was reported in the news article, none of us got any timely transport or hotel accommodation. We literally disembarked the plane at 2 15 am leh. So we were basically left stranded and awake the whole night with no idea what to do until we checked in for our replacement SQ flight at 6 am. The post-disruption management was extremely poor and fell far short of expectations, especially for an airline under the SIA group.\n\nNonetheless, one heck of an experience lor especially considering we opted for a flight back instead of a bus/train to save time but end up the whole flight journey became 12 hrs+ 😂",

Like throughout their whole adult life, they hv had no friends outside her socio-demo group and race. This disappointed and shocked me because we are from a multi racial and religious society. As someone from a minority racial group i have met people with such a mindset and preferences when I was in spore but they r very closed minded, hv a lot of group think and r ignorntt so I can't click with them very well. It's disappointing that to a certain degree that I'm starting to feel the same way towards them.\n\nI thought that is fine but I realised after talking to them that they prefer to mix arnd with ang moh ppl. Like white locals when there r so many diverse races in San Fran. They would actually put it on insta to show that these ppl r their friends. It's absolutely SO cringe. In convos, they wld make passing remarks that makes me feel that they prioritise befriending ang moh white ppl. Like they would ask oh is your friend white? N that is quite disappointing because my friend is a human. So I know what they r trying to do by displaying those pics on insta story. \n\nWe are all racist to a certain degree. I know I am and try to be mindful and not generalise but damn I won't wanna display it for the whole world to see. I just came to a realisation that it doesn't matter if we come from a multi racial and multi religious society and this whole facade of displaying diversity, even if we have that environment back home, we cannot force people to integrate and befriend other races even if we are conditioned to appreciate it through education. If they wanna shun or idolise a specific race, it is actually on them.\n\nI'm not looking for any advice because it is what it is but fellow sporeans overseas, have you met other sporeans like this? Is it a thing?. I just wanted to express my disappointment that I thought by living overseas, we should open our minds and not 110% act on our prejudices overseas like how we did back home (for those who do). I know for sure though, if we had met in Spore, we wldnt ever be friends because I don't fit into that specific socio demo grp.

I think most Singaporeans who move to SF are Chinese, from a privileged background, and like you say, may not have minority friends for the above-mentioned reasons. \n\nThere’s also the aspect of (someone else here mentioned this) of Chinese Singaporeans being somewhat absorbed quickly into the East Asian / AAPI model minority thing, even if we didn’t consciously participate in it. We are put in a box of ‘somewhere between a Chinese person from China and a Chinese American person’. Goes without saying that people perceive us as Chinese rather than Singaporean. And if you work in tech, it is absolutely a class thing. \n\nSF as a city is also overwhelmingly white and Chinese or other East Asian due to demographics and gentrification. Chinese Singaporeans also tend to bring our weird vibes about race here (I try not to ask many folks here I know about what they think about Black people.. coz I know the answer)\n\nIf you’re someone who never interrogated your own race / friendships back home, you probably won’t be someone who does that elsewhere. \n\nI think there are two broad groups of Singaporeans in SF: people who only hang out with other Singaporeans and can’t wait to get home, and these folks tend to be meet the profile you described, and everyone else. \n\nThe only joy I’ve had in the community has been through food networks and groups that are joint SG/Malaysian events or communities. They tend to be more diverse and open. Most of my friends are other immigrants from all countries, because I find that I connect more easily on that one large part of my life. \n\nAlso, ‘San Fran’ will earn you bad vibes here! \n\nI think over time that evens out a bit. My Singaporean friends who have been here more than a decade are very different people from who they are back home. Especially if they have kids and they are participating in more everyday life things, like school. Otherwise, if you’re working here in tech and that’s your entire life, then yeah, it is very white and other Asian. ",

Sad but true common experience. I am Chinese SGean, not religious, went to Chinese schools, so everyone I had significant social interaction with (i.e. people at school) was also Chinese. Certainly all my close friends were, except for one Chinese-Indian friend who transferred schools because she was having a shitty time there (e.g. being forced to enroll in Higher Chinese when she didn't even use the language at home. I hope as mixed families become more common in SG and Chinese standards fall that nobody else has that particular experience nowadays.) Do I now as an adult realize how cloistered my upbringing was? Sure. But anyway, I cannot change my past experiences, and neither can your friend.\n\nPart 2, your friend chasing angmoh. Remember the term sarong party girl? I think it's kind of odd behavior honestly that your friend is so obsessed with specifically befriending them to the extent of asking \"is your friend white\". ESPECIALLY in the Bay Area which like you said is so diverse. I don't agree with the other commenter that this is just a matter of seeking out other perspectives if your friend is both exclusively seeking out white friends AND avoiding Americans of other races.\n\n(A slightly kinder perspective: maybe something about your friend's angmoh friends is more comforting or welcoming or familiar? maybe they are running away from something? or seeking a specific community that happens to be white-dominated?)\n\nPart 3, have I met other overseas Singaporeans who are like your friend? Yes and no. People are different obviously, and people move overseas looking for different things. My hunch is that my specific history and personality have made me value diversity/openness much more than most other overseas Chinese Singaporeans I have met. Most. Not all. \n\nMaybe over time living in the US and becoming a minority will help develop your friend's empathy.

I said, \"Hello, I was here first, there’s already a queue\"\n\nShe replied, “Since when?”\n\nI said, \"Since before you arrived.\" (wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt maybe she ddnt notice but I was literally standing there the whole time in a bright coloured shirt, there's no way she didn't saw me right??, I know some might think it’s a crime, but c’mon, I like my shirt hahaha.)\n\nThere was about 5 seconds of awkward silence, and even the taxi uncle gave a small beep.\n\nThen she said, \"Ok you take lah!\" in a pretty annoyed tone. I took the taxi.\n\nNow I’m wondering, AITA for insisting? In my mind I was like, \"Not my first rodeo, lady.\" 😏 A few similar instances have happened to me before, and I tend to stand my ground if the person looks around my age.\n\nI know it’s morning rush hour and everyone’s rushing to work. But at the same time, isn’t there a basic taxi stand etiquette? Also, I realized I tend to feel more intimidated if it’s older people doing this. I get scared to confront them. But if it’s someone around my age, I can stand my ground.\n\nWas I being unreasonable for speaking up? All I want to say to the people who cut queues; I hope someone calls you out on the spot!!! And have some shame!!!",

The environment is dirty, noisy and dusty. Safety is another factor. Most of the workers there are Indian/Bangladeshi/Malaysian/PRC. You often have to use broken English to communicate well with them. Some people really can't get used to it.\n\n4. The working hours start at 7.30am? But it also ends early la. But if its at Tuas megayard and you stay at East Side, need to travel very far.\n\n5. Marine/Oil and gas are not as rosy as it was used to be compared to early 2010s. Last time Keppel and Sembcorp are the big brothers of rig building but oil and gas upstream has changed so much over the last 10 years it is not as profitable as before.\n\n6. Depending on the roles, project engineer/production engineer doing project ships can have very high stress because of tight schedules. Commisioning engineers need to OT like mad near handover time. You will get shouted/berated a lot or reciprocate to your vendors for many stressful issues.\n\nThe above honestly applies to much of the traditional engineering work.

I was in a field role so I got the full deal of wearing a hard hat, coveralls and going up to the vessels such as rigs and FPSO etc. But I left in the end and I suggest you better leave this industry as well. Many reasons as below:\n\n\n- Safety. Saw an injury from an unintended discharge from a hydraulic line at 200-300 bar. Had a colleague who fell from a 3 storey height due to poor safety barriers erection by contractors. No amount of $$ can buy back your limbs or life.\n\n- Field work is tough and even tougher when you are older. I knew i didn’t want to be climbing up gangways or flare towers when I’m 40 plus.\n\n- Oil and gas is cyclical and I got laid off at another company when oil price crash. And given the green transition to renewable energies, this is a mega trend which is unstoppable. Oil and gas will play a smaller role in the future. \n\n- Your enemy is not AI but the decline of this industry in Singapore. This industry has been increasingly moving to other countries and we are now very far from the heydays where Keppel was renowned as a world leader for its B class jack up rigs and the yard were packed with ever increasing orders backlog and foreign workers. These days, the yards are very quiet. \n\n\nMarine vessels are dominated by Chinese and Korean yards. Rig building and vessel conversions is steadily declining in Singapore. Your future options are to move to these countries to work. Many oil and gas and marine contractors are now located in KL as their APAC HQ instead.\n\n\nYou can DM me, always happy to have a chat with someone who has worked in this industry that i have worked in before .",

Company bus is provided, but you reach the office before 7am because the company bus has other commitments or just wants to avoid peak jam. They also do not drop you door to door, you have to get picked/dropped at designated locations.\n\n3) Work environment - dangerous, dirty, smelly. You put on the PPE and helmet with safety glasses at all times on the site. Not sure about you, but I like to be clean and sip my coffee in front of a desk rather than roughing it under the sun and breathing in barnacle shit and paint fumes and dusts.\n\n4) Work place culture - toxic like f. It is all for yourself out there. Need somebody from other dept to help with coordination? Need to beg and see their face color. Your own boss /colleagues within same dept also gatekeep their knowledge so they can remain the guru while you navigate the politics and workflow by yourself. Basically shitty singaporean work culture.\n\nSo glad I left this hellhole and never looked back.

          "text": "Hey i’m sorry about your circumstances. I would suggest figuring out first:\n\n1) Funds - where will the money to buy food, necessities and pay bills be coming from first? Where are your parent’s cards and cash stored? How much money in their bank account? Do you need financial aid? Approach your nearest family service centre or Social service office for assistance. \n\n2) Valuables - Where is everyone’s passports and nrics and other valuables. In the event of a fire or housebreak-in, do you know where to find them to make sure they are still there? \n\n3) Bills- Tax, Internet, Phone, Gas, Water supply and Electricity - they should have payment instructions on their website and also a phone number to call to find out if you have outstanding bills\n\n3.5) Debt and loans - Ask your parents if they owe anyone money. Are they still repaying a car or HDB loan or insurance premium? Need to figure out how to continue w monthly payments if needed. \n\n4) Communication - If your parents are working and were detained suddenly, there might be employers or concerned friends calling wondering where they might be. Be prepared for an answer acceptable to you? If your parents were known to social service before, do you know how you can reach their social workers for help?\nIf any of your parents friends or people in their drug consumption network approach u looking for them for whatever reasons- learn how to keep urself and grandma safe in case things go sideway. \n\n5) Medicine - Check if your grandma has any medicine she needs to take daily and where they are located. Can go to her GP or polyclinic to restock as they should have her records.\n\n6) HYGIENE - A house can get dirty really fast. Clean toilet and bathroom at least once a week. Do not mix bleach with toilet cleaner!!!! It will produce toxic gases. So yah I learned that the hard way the first time I cleaned my bathroom. Please for the love of everything do not anyhow mix cleaning chemicals just because they all advertise it can clean bathrooms. \nDo not let laundry pile up. Learn how to use washing machine, and iron. \n\n6.5) Food safety: Check your current food supplies and clear expired ones. Clear old food from refrigerators regularly - fresh fruit and veg can go bad in a week. check internet for food safety when cooking and food storage. Watch for mold. Usually if you dabao food don’t keep in fridge for more than two days. Try not to leave cooked food in room temperature for days. Also check if your containers can be microwaved - some cannot. No metal utensils on non-stick coating cos the surface will scratch and release toxic chemicals. Do NOT put metallic objects in a microwave unless they say its microwave safe. \n\n7) Emergency - if locked out or something leaking or spoil, save number of locksmith, 24/7 plumber, electrician, internet provider number in case got blackout. Learn where your house circuit breaker is and how it works in case power trips\n\n8) Community Support - This is a stressful time and you shouldn’t do it alone! Get help if you must! No shame ok there are more people willing to help someone whose parents are separated from them. Get to know your neighbours, religious community if any, and call your friends. They can help u with chores or getting stuff or just lending a listening ear. We are not meant to do this alone.\n\nJiayous!",

      "selftext": "Context: My girlfriend is Burmese, and like many people back home, left the country amidst the military coup and political instability. She enrolled in private diploma course in Singapore, did an internship and subsequently went on to work for the company in the F&amp;B industry. We met while I did a gig job at the shop.\n\nHer company is a small shop with a focus on selling traditional desserts, located somewhere in central Singapore. They expanded to a secondary outlet but it closed down less than a year due to poor sales. The original outlet also suffered from poor sales and the owner failed to renegotiate a new lease, resulting in a relocation to a new location, where my girlfriend is currently at. In between the lease expiry and the set-up of the new location, my girlfriend did not draw a salary for about 2 months but was held on as an employee because the boss said \"don't worry I know going back to Myanmar is very difficult now\". I was initially grateful for the gesture but things turned bad.\n\nGF has been with the shop since the beginning, and you could say I am biased but she has been really diligent. On some days even when she was unwell, she refused to be on medical leave as it would be \"bad for the company and difficult for colleagues\". She gets one off day per week, which is common for F&amp;B. What I am concerned about are her working hours.\n\nBack at the original store, her shift is 1100-2300, with a 1-hour break. When she was selected to go to the second shop, her hours became 1000-2100, similarly with a 1-hour break. At the newest location, her work hours are 0700-2000, and while there's a 1-hour break on paper, she gets about 15-20 minutes to eat at most. That works out to be more than 72 hours per week. Her boss also recently informed that they will be unable to take an off day for 2 weeks as another Malaysian colleague will be on leave. I know this is a clear violation of so many MOM regulations, and I really want to confront the management on her behalf and write in to the relevant authorities, but I am really afraid of the backlash she might receive.\n\nShe has been applying for numerous jobs but was always met with \"sorry no quota\". As a Burmese, she requires a Work Permit (NTS) which means there must be a higher corresponding number of locals in the company before a Burmese van be hired. Additionally, there is a limit to the roles she can work, such as manufacturering, F&amp;B and housekeeping.\n\nDespite being with her shop for almost 3 years, her boss seems to favour 2 new Malaysian staff that was recently hired; giving them more authority and leeway compared to my GF and her other Burmese colleague. She is really very exhausted but looking for a new job is proving an uphill task and she is afraid to voice out to the current boss lest her work permit gets cancelled. An alternative would be to apply for a job via an agent, but I have been scrawling through the postings for the past few weeks and most of them are either similarly bad or worse off. Majority of the jobs posted provide a median salary of $1500 with either 1 or 2 off day the entire month. This is excluding a hefty agent fee of about $6000. Not sure how they exploit certain loopholes when it is clearly listed that workers on a WP should be paid a minimum wage of $2000.\n\nThank you for reading and any advice is greatly appreciated.",

I have volunteered with the Myanmar community and exploitation of Myanmar workers is more common because unlike workers from other countries, going home is not a real option for them. They have accrued massive debt just to get out and they risk not being able to get another passport, etc. This is why when they have to change jobs, they go to Thailand or Indonesia rather than go back to Myanmar. \n\n3. The problem is that any MOM investigation may lead to her wrongful termination. And yes, if she is fired, she is going to have to challenge that it was wrongful. This will cost money. In the mean time, she has no income, place to stay or even a valid permit to stay in the country. \n\n4. Even if she is not deemed to be a whistleblower, the risk of termination purely based on lack of money is real. \n\n5. OP  - at this point, you are aware of the harsh reality that she is in and the options are very limited. But your concerns are very real that she will work herself to death at this rate. Frankly, so many in Myanmar were eager to get out and agents exploit this with high fees and then leave them in terrible work situations. And Singapore sounds better for them compared to Malaysian and Thailand (also lots of Myanmar folks there) but we also have work conditions like this. \n\n6. Options I can see. \n\nA. Give feedback (through her and her colleagues), to the bosses that they cannot tahan. Yes, there is a risk but if the owner is smart, they also know they cannot work them to the bone. It is possible they continue with the conditions because they genuinely think that Myanmar people don't mind. \n\nB. Threat of escalation (through her or yourself) to MOM. This is a gamble, since it can definitely lead to retaliation. In this case, both need to be ready for work place retaliation as well as unjust firing. You may need to set aside funds/accom while she fights the case. \n\nC. Quit. Commit to finding another job in sg or overseas. This comes with a real risk of long term separation. \n\nD. Commit to marriage early. We should not take marriage lightly at all but if both of you are really sure that you want to be with each other, then it does ease a lot of the problems that you had on your mind. \n\n  \nGood luck bro.

As a middle aged, mid income citizen, cost of living pressures, job security, healthcare costs and care of elderly parents are real pressures. \n\nEach of these are pressure points that I feel would make me want to reconsider having children. \n\nMy parents were middle class citizens. With two working adults, they were able to afford a house and pay it off in 15 years, a car that cost about a year’s salary, and a helper. \n\nTheir parents were in their late 50s and retired when we were born which facilitated childcare arrangements. \n\nHolidays were simple affairs, mostly Malaysia and Indonesia. Only when we became teenagers did more exotic destinations like Thailand, China and Japan come into the picture. Europe and US were O-Level, A-Level grad presents. \n\nLife seemed simpler but more manageable. You bought assets, be it stocks or property, its value visibly increased over time. You could upgrade properties inline with wage growth or own a second one as rental income.\n\nLife today feels worse off, there’s no job security, asset appreciation is outpacing wage growth, even as middle income adults keeping up with cost pressures is a real challenge. \n\nThis is not a criticism of Singapore as I think we are an amazing country. I also observe the same in many other first world cities. \n\nHence I question the need to have kids in such an environment and would like to hear the thoughts of others.

It feels more like a combination of multiple factors, which eventually means you will have to handle everything on your own anyhow, especially in the middle-class. What this means is that the money pressure is definitely there, since SG is a developed nation and to maintain that attractiveness, things do get expensive with our tiny piece of land. Even more so when you have growing mouths to feed, and aging mouths to take care of. \n\nBut the crux seems to be that we are now more concerned about the future of our children, and directly picking up that pressure. It is not that people are getting more selfish, self-centered and wanting to enjoy life for themselves. It is rather how do we see a brighter future where kids will flourish, how can we provide, compared to those expat children who have a lot more resources, and a home back in their country where they can go back to in case things do not work out. Our parents are in the era where hard work pays off, and they somehow have the belief that their kids will make it. It is seldom the case now. Those who have kids, are really those who love having kids, and will find ways to make it work (of course lets not consider the accidents :p) \n\nHow could it be more palatable for locals? As cost of living is always on the rise, could we have adopted the 'flexibility' for locals to perhaps own 2 properties, to stay and to rent out for growing number of foreigners, so Singaporeans can have additional income and asset? Could this help prevent casual marriages for the sake of BTOs and housing? Could we have adopted better tax benefits that help care for our seniors instead of just taxing the working class and expanding MRT lines? Or could we have better job protection to stop companies from doing layoffs for the sake of their books? \n\nUltimately there are too many considerations, and would say that if you really want to have kids, just go with it. You can never predict the future, so there is no point in trying to logic it out because you will just end up not having it. ",

      "selftext": "I’m a teen working part time at a restaurant. Before working, I have been struggling with stuttering and my memory. I can easily blank out completely and forget a conversation just that happened just a while ago (though I think is pretty common). Nontheless I thought a fast paced environment would help me to overcome these issues that I have been (still am) facing.\n\nI’ve been working for almost to 4 months, so there are certain expectations that people have of me.\n\nYesterday however, I was working a full shift. In the afternoon, I was not in the right state of mind. It was very heavy and hazy. This subsequently  affected my performance at night, despite me stationed at a position I’m very familiar with. I was so slow, pacing back and forth, and did many things wrongly. This was very unusual of me, even my coworkers realised. One of them asked me if I was okay since I seemed very stressed and not knowing what to do. At that point in time, I knew I messed up shitloads. But I still had to keep going.\n\nThat was when I was super unlucky. I accidentally cut myself with a staple bullet. I didn’t know the cut was deeper than a usual paper cut until blood started leaking on the receipts I touched. I was shocked. Those receipts were meant to be given to the customers. Thankfully though, those customers didn’t want a receipt from the start so I could keep the extra clean spare one. The problem though was that it didn’t stop bleeding for 10-15 minutes, and there were still a long line of customers who wanted to pay.\n\nBeing a cashier, you’d have to wipe the tables after helping customers to pay. Unluckily the two tables I had to wipe had pools of water customers accidentally spilled, which would take me much more time to clean. Moreover more and more customers wanted to pay, so I had to stop what I was doing and go back to the cashier.\n\nMy breaking point was when a guy ordered takeaway. He basically wanted to order a bottle of wine, but restaurant policy states that takeaway orders for wine would require customers to buy something else with it. I told him and he said he will consider. He came back and I double checked with him “So you want the red wine? A whole bottle?”, then he said, in a tone I’m not sure condescending “You mean we can order a glass of wine for takeaway”. This made me think about that one time I actually made this mistake when I was still new, so my voice just cracked and I started breaking down.\n\nLater on after closing, the same colleague asked me the same question, whether I was okay since tonight was extremely messy. This happened infront of two other colleagues. I didn’t mean to break down in front of them. I really didn’t. However, I kept thinking about my incompetence at work, how even after 4 months I couldn’t be as quick as my colleagues, and that I kept stammering. Coupled with flashbacks when my mother scolded me for being useless, incapable, and that she ultimately raised a pig. (She said this more than once). Moreover, when I’m stressed, I sometimes hear voices calling me, which makes me go crazy since sometimes I’ll walk up to customers asking if they needed anything, and my colleagues will see it as I’m walking back and forth. At that point, I just couldn’t take it anymore. I was incompetent to say the least. I was problematic and practically a burden. I wish I had the authority to deny, but looking at what’d I done, having my colleagues to resolve so many of my mistakes yesterday night, overwhelmed me with guilt.",

Only a doctor/psychiatrist would be in the position to evaluate you and rule out other possible medical issues.\n\nThis series of events is not common nor normal, and this has caused you issues with your day to day functioning. At this point, it becomes a condition that requires professional help. Everything you're experiencing is common amongst neurodivergent people. For some of us, it's worst in childhood. The good news is that as adults, usually, things \"settle down\" a bit already.\n\nIf you want, you can DM me/ask me here and I can help you make sense of things so you can bring it to a doctor. I've been through the medical system in SG so I know the cost-efficient route. My DMs are always open ya if you feel you don't want to share too much publicly! Hugs and take care!",

He said it was the first time he felt like a foreigner in his own country.\n\nBack then, I was working in the same area, serving one of the big banks. Every morning I would walk past a department with glass walls. One day I glanced in. Row after row of desks. Computer screens glowing. And every single person inside seemed to be from the same foreign country. It's like a foreign village planted into the room. \n\n \n\nYesterday, I read a post from a fellow Singaporean working in an office in the West. He said most of his colleagues were foreigners. They had their own lingo, their own inside jokes, their own favorite lunch spots. He found himself listening to conversations he could not quite follow. Smiling when everyone laughed, even when he did not fully get the joke. He said he felt like a minority in his own turf.\n\n \n\nWhen you sit in your own office and feel like the outsider, something shifts quietly inside your identity.  It is just a subtle dislocation. Like the furniture in your house has been rearranged and you are still trying to find the light switch in the dark.\n\nLast night, after dinner, I walked into the mall nearby. I had not been there since Covid. Same building. Same escalators. But it felt unfamiliar. Many of the shop signs were brands from one particular foreign country. I caught myself wondering where the local brands had gone.\n\nAnother day, my wife and I visited a neighborhood shop. The cashier could not speak English. We stumbled through the transaction. It was awkward.\n\nIn your workplace, do you ever feel like a guest in your own country?\n\nSome of us carry a quiet ache that is hard to explain. It is not about hating anyone. It is not about rejecting change. It is simply the feeling of being slightly displaced in a place you once knew so well.\n\nWe start asking ourselves, softly: Is this still my home?\n\nOr am I slowly becoming a minority in my own land?\n\nIt is a strange feeling to have.\n\nMaybe all I am really saying is this.\n\nI just want to feel at home.",

Milk for nostalgia. \n\nI envy my SG-Malay friends. The culture is at least protected to some extent. They are minority but not withstanding the effect of PRC or India migrant culture erosion. I love speaking to them. They are the last group I can 100% interact with and know they understand what I’m talking about at least a good 80% in spirit, in nostalgia and in mindset.",

      "selftext": "I feel like such a horrible person for even thinking about these things, but I honestly don't know who to talk to without sounding like a judgmental person.\n\nI’ve been with my BF for close to a year. He’s the sweetest guy, super hardworking, and I love him to bits. Yesterday was the first time I went to his place for CNY reunion dinner. For context, I know that my family and his family has some SES differences, but I haven’t been bothered by it until yesterday.\n\nMy family stays in a landed home in District X. I knew he stayed in a 3-room HDB , but seeing it in person was a total culture shock.\n\nThe moment I stepped in, I felt so out of place. The house was so cramped, and the smell of cooking oil was everywhere because the kitchen is right next to the living room. His parents don't speak a word of English, only very loud, broken Hokkien/Mandarin.\n\nI tried my best to smile and use my limited Hokkien to communicate with them. I wanted to make a good impression, so I really dressed up. I wore a modest designer cheongsam (the lace one from SC brand) with some jewellery.\n\nI thought I looked respectful and  proper for the elders. However, this has bad fired badly. His dad was quite uncouth... throughout dinner, he kept staring at me. He made some comments in Hokkien like, \"Wah, your gf so 'swee,' body also very 'tok kong.' You better faster make her pregnant so she don't run away.\" Then he winked and made some hand gestures that made me feel so violated. Everyone else (including his siblings and mum) laughed like it was a normal joke, even my BF just chuckled and told him to eat more. I felt so cheap.\n\nNow I’m caught in a dilemma. I love my BF, but I’m thinking about our future. If we get married, my parents (who are very refined/particular about etiquette) have to sit across the table from a man who makes sexual jokes about his own daughter-in-law? I duno how both of our families can mingle in future. Now I feel so naive for thinking \"love conquers all.\" Is this what life is going to be like? Am I being a classist snob for being bothered by the 3-room flat and the lack of manners, or am I right to be scared? Please don't roast me as an entitled princess as I’m already feeling like trash, so appreciate constructive comments and advice to help me clear my mind.",

Singaporeans were a massive **82%** majority, meaning almost everyone shared a permanent, lifelong stake in the nation. The streets were quieter and the social fabric was uniform, as the non-resident workforce was just beginning to expand. Back then, the country functioned as a tight-knit nation-state where the vast majority of people held voting rights and a multi-generational claim to the land.\n\nIn **2026**, the population has surged to **6.15 million**, yet the citizen share has shrunk to just **59%**. While the total population grew by **68%**, the non-resident group exploded by over **530%**, reaching nearly **2 million**. This demographic shift has transformed the island into a high-pressure global hub where citizens of the country are increasingly outnumbered by transient residents. The physical density is compounded by an ageing crisis, with **21%** of citizens now **over 65**, leaving a smaller core of local stakeholders to navigate an unrecognisably crowded city.\n\nCrucially, the **59%** citizen figure is **deceptive** because it ignores the distinction between natural-born and naturalised citizens. The data masks the influx of adults who may not share the local culture or have served National Service (for males). This internal shift means the proportion of \"traditional\" stakeholders with deep roots is even lower than official stats suggest. Today, the [native-born](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/native-born) Singaporean finds themselves in a city where nearly **1 in 3 people** is a temporary guest, fundamentally altering the sense of home that existed thirty years ago.\n\n_________\n**Tl;DR:** Since **1996**, Singapore's population has hit close to **6.2 million** while the citizen stake diluted from **82% to 59%**. This **59%** includes many new citizens who didn't grow up locally or serve NS, meaning traditional stakeholders now share a much denser country with **2 million** non-residents. How much lower will this figure go in another three decades?\n_______\n\nOfficial Data Sources: [Singstat](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/) (For Censuses held decennially, [latest in 2020](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/publications/reference/cop2020/cop2020-sr1)) and [National Population and Talent Division](https://www.population.gov.sg/) (For Population In Briefs held annually, [latest in 2025](https://www.population.gov.sg/files/media-centre/publications/Population_in_Brief_2025.pdf) and [visual by ST](https://i.imgur.com/gH7Ynnh.png)).",

Locally born Singaporeans’ jobs have been affected. Many of the immigrants have also been granted PRs and citizenship without clear justification.\n\nThe unhappiness with immigrants is a natural reaction. It’s also displayed in Japan, Europe, Australia and Canada.\n\nI don’t think the general Singaporean is racist. Stop calling them that. This isn’t purely racism.\n\nYou cannot deny the general population’s anger when many people of different nationalities with fake degrees and bad cultural practices come over to take away jobs. You probably don’t feel it because you are retired.\n\nIt seems to me also that you don’t drive at all. It’s baffling how strong the impact of the car could be at that small road unless the driver was speeding and driving recklessly. You mean people are not supposed to feel angry about this?\n\nAnd go read the article carefully again: After knocking down the hapless child, her car moved again and rolled over the abdomen of her mother. Was it twice?\n\nWho drives like this?\n\nOh Bertha, you are saying people shouldn’t feel angry? You are such an angel hor. No apologies here, but we are humans here with emotions. We can’t fake it.\n\nAnd looking at the many photos, you mean you cannot interpret from the driver’s stance that she was not remorseful at all? Who the f would stand and gesticulate after fatally knocking down a young pedestrian and using the car to roll over the abdomen of her mother?!!\n\nOh oh… this was supposed to be merely an accident and that we should all calm down. Don’t get mad. It’s an honest human mistake. Doesn’t matter who is driving the car.\n\nGoodness. We don’t need a moral police here.

The father’s heart-wrenching cries at the scene moved people across the island to grief for the family’s loss.\n\nYet even before police investigations were completed, social media had already launched a trial by public opinion against the driver. Some netizens narrated the incident in a tone resembling that of eyewitnesses, layering on vivid “details” through speculation and conjecture. In the process, they swiftly labeled the driver as “CECA.”\n\n“CECA” is the abbreviation for the Singapore–India Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement. In online discourse, it is also used to refer to new immigrants from India.\n\nAlthough those conducting this online trial may represent only a vocal minority, it is worth asking: when faced with such a heartbreaking accident, why do some people’s first instinct is to vent dissatisfaction toward a particular community?\n\nIt cannot be denied that the anger some netizens direct at “CECA” may reflect deeper anxieties—long-standing unease about immigration policies, social integration, and perceived disruptions to local ways of life. Such emotions deserve to be acknowledged, but they must not be expressed in this manner.\n\nIt should also be emphasized that the police have acted. The 38-year-old female driver has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by negligent driving. Claims that the authorities would “let CECA off the hook” are entirely baseless and serve only to inflame social divisions.\n\nAnother point of controversy concerns eyewitness accounts alleging that the driver, while speaking to the girl’s father at the scene, raised her voice and made a palm-up gesture while explaining herself. Some netizens interpreted this as arrogance or an attempt to shirk responsibility.\n\nThe Swiss-American psychiatrist Elisabeth Kübler-Ross proposed the “Five Stages of Grief” model to describe how people respond to death or severe trauma. Three of these stages are denial, anger, and bargaining. This framework may, at times, help explain the behavior of those involved in traumatic incidents.\n\nI was not at the scene, nor do I know any of the individuals involved. I have no intention of excusing negligent driving. However, the driver’s behavior at the accident scene might be interpreted through this lens.\n\nAs for what punishment she should receive, that must be determined by the law—not by destroying her character based solely on her identity, tone, or body language.\n\nAt the time of writing, the deceased has been laid to rest, and the injured remains hospitalized. May the departed rest in peace, may the injured recover swiftly, and may our society show a little more understanding and a little less hatred—so that emotional outbursts do not overshadow thoughtful reflection on the incident and accountability for it.\"",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, Im currently waiting for uni and came across an internship ad, applied and I want to check if this sounds like a legit internship or actually a financial advisor recruitment pipeline.\n\nI was contacted about a 2-month “financial consulting / summer internship” programme based at Alexandria Point. The person said they offer free certifications and personality assessments, and mentioned exposure to financial consulting and client work.  Apparently graduates with no experience in the sector are welcomed too\n\nHowever, before the second round interview, they asked me to fill in a Google Form requesting quite personal financial details, including:\n\n\t•\tmonthly income / allowance\n\n\t•\tmonthly expenses\n\n\t•\ttotal savings\n\n\t•\tinvestment portfolio details\n\n\t•\twhether I have insurance\n\n\t•\tCPF balances\n\nThey also mentioned:\n\n\t•\tcertifications sponsorship\n\n\t•\tpersonality profiling\n\n\t•\tface-to-face meetings\n\n\t•\tpossible overseas exposure\n\nIt’s under an individual campaign name (“Lei On Me”) by a financial advisor (name given: Shi Lei Ho), not directly through a big company HR portal.\n\nHas anyone encountered similar programmes? Is this typically FA/insurance agent recruitment rather than a standard internship? IMO it already sounds like a MLM, or just an FA recruitment trap, but i wanna get some opinions, who knows, i do want to broaden my opportunities, just not sure if this is the way to go.\n\nI don’t have the ad link i applied to, but just provided a few of the questions i was asked to fill out \n\nWould appreciate any experiences or advice — thank you.",

The risk about diy is it might get contested in law should there be disagreement among the beneficiaries (or even non beneficiaries who feel they should be beneficiaries) of what you really mean in your Will, esp if they are not straightforward, or whether you were of sound mind when you wrote the Will. As my kids are still young (as is yours), my Will also includes a testamentary trust which my executor will need to enforce, that is, only a certain sum of living expenses is taken out from my estate annually for my minor children, until they reach a certain age then the remaining funds will be distributed to them).\n\nAnother thing you didn't mention is CPF nominations.

      "selftext": "Hi all, don't come to this sub very often, but someone commented to me that there's this misconception about funds, and it's actually a pet peeve of mine, so I thought I would drop an explainer.\n\nI've been in the fund industry for quite a while, mostly on the operation side and I would want to clarify something about dividends. Basically, I find that a lot of Singaporeans like to chase dividends in funds, sometimes to an irrational level. \n\nBasically how a fund would is the money from all the investors are pulled to buy shares. This allow investors to gain broad exposure to investments, some that they do not have direct access to. Other than ETFs which trade on the market, it should be noted that the fund price that you regularly see is based on the fund's investment portfolio, along with operational cash-equivalent entries (cash, receivables, payables). ETF are also priced this way, but because it's traded on a board, the trading price may move from the calculated price, but generally not to a big degree.\n\nNow, back to dividends. When a fund pays dividends, it is from a fund's assets. It will pay from it's cash, and if that is insufficient, it will sell some stocks to make up the difference. The corresponding effect is that a fund price will always fall after paying out the dividend, unless its portfolio movement makes up the difference.\n\nStocks are paid at investor's perceived value of the company and expected future cashflows. Dividends paid from stocks can have a positive impact on the perceived value and increase the stock price even when stocks pay out dividends. This does not happen with funds. Funds pay out dividends from assets that are already yours. You don't magically gain any value from dividends other than cashflow, which could be a valid reason to wanting dividends from some people.\n\nNow, something that even fewer people knows about. Dividends cost money to the fund. Fund administrators (the ones doing the operational work for the fund managers) typically charge a fee for each transaction to the fund. This includes dividends. And note that this is for each transaction. That means a flat fee is typically charged for each dividend transaction paid to each receiving investor. Typically, you are paying a small amount for each dividend you received. \n\nSo there you have it. Hope this post helps people understand the underlying mechanics a bit better and make wiser decisions.\n\n",

She'll protect you from them better than anyone especially when you are blindly in love.\n3. Get the right GF, eat at home etc. You'll save at least 50 percent or more.\n4. Now take more risk. CSPX or VWRA are not really considered that risky.  Any amount below 50k is small and peanuts.\n5. But while you are learning, keep lumping sum to VWRA. Not CSPX, but if you are die hard s&amp;p500 like so many young people are, then SPYL. You need to do it asap as time is your friend.\n6. if you are indeed only s&amp;p500, then take more risk into SSO etf 2 X leverage\n7. try to avoid the UPRO or TQQQ for now till you read up the dangers.\n8. Preferably, take risk via your parents by borrowing from them paying them 2 percent returns (still better than FDs)\n9. Because your sums are so small. Avoid the UK domiciled ETFs, hence avoid those above LSE etfs for now and go for the US domiciled ones. You can then buy 1k USD every time rather than the 3.4k USD sweet spot for LSE domiciled.\n10. You are now left with VTI/VXUS (combo). or pure VOO, VTI, SSO (if u are s&amp;p500 die hard)\n11. Now if you are global indexer aka VTI/VXUS...find a way to lever this combo. maybe a 25 percent SSO/75percent VXUS...\n12. Always remember, the dangers of leveraged ETFs..e.g flat market is where its dangerous like current USA markets. In 2008, its eerily similar before the crash. But crashes are fine for leveraged etfs, its the flat ones for long time that are bad.\n13. Once you reach 60k USD, time to sell and move to LSE.\n14. But you still need to SSO etf some what, thus tag to something else\n15. Only gold are power diversifiers, not perfect. Limit to no more than 30 percent if you are leveraging your equities with SSO or UPRO or TQQQ. TMF like any bonds are bad IMO. Otherwise, 5 percent. Gold is especially useful to solo CSPX only investors. If you are global indexer, you don't need as much.\n16. if all sounds too confusing. I personally tell my kids to only focus on risky etfs that make sense when you are very young and broke. i.e SSO + avuv / avdv + eimi. This is the global index value diversified high risk. If your amount is large, then IWVL on LSE.\n17. if wanna up the risk even more. Then apply relative momentum and review every month. i.e. only pick one. Current winner I believe its either avdv or eimi. I'll take avdv(small caps) or IWVL(large caps) if on LSE.\n18. If you kiasi, then dual momentum like I do. In fact, young should also dual momentum to some extent.\n19. always remember why diversification is so important. a 50 percent drop, takes 100 percent to recover. Never be stupid to think cuz you have long time frame. The bar has moved to greater than 20 years to what is considered long time frame. A pure USA even with long time frame can still end up Japan style multi decades crash.\n20. Don't think you are smarter than the market beta(it actually consists of small caps and mid cap too ). The market beta is the global market cap, not USA alone. Only with a global mindset can you rely on long time frame cuz it will not take decades to recover if adversity occurs.\n21.

A somewhat deflationary mindset is beginning to set in -- no 'urgency' to consume now since inflation remains very low, and intense competition plus over-production from excess capacity means prices continue falling over time. This is why some are cautioning that China may fall into a similar deflationary spiral like Japan in the 90s, if more is not done to reform the economy.\n\nThere are also signs that China is experiencing a \"liquidity trap\". 30-year bond yields are ~2.2%, but credit impulse has not picked up meaningfully. Cuts to the RRR (reserve req ratio) unleashing liquidity into the financial system have not been meaningfully stimulatory.\n\nStock market-wise, it is quite clear policymakers are trying to engineer a gradual market rally, whilst trying to boost household participation in stocks in hopes of spurring consumption through the wealth effect. The \"National Team\" has been selling stocks so far this year (they were big buyers in 2024 to support the market). For Hong Kong-listed equities, daily southbound net buying through the StockConnect has materially slowed, and certainly days are actually seeing outflows. More importantly, earnings have not materially grown y/y at the index level, so last year's rally was mostly driven by valuation multiple expansion.\n\nGiven current circumstances, it seems that a slow grind higher in Chinese stocks is the most likely outcome for this year, barring a trade war re-escalation. We may come to a point where \"bad is good\" -- poor data forces policymakers to rollout more stimulus, that should ultimately benefit the stock market. Also quite unlikely that Chinese stocks catch up to their East Asian breathren given the absence of the AI thematic (Korea/Taiwan) or broad fiscal stimulus (Japan).",

Yields curve inversion simply means that the market expects short-term (ie. overnight) interest rates to fall in the future. It does not necessarily predict recession, but can coincide with one. In theory, yields curves should steepen when in an interest rate cutting cycle.\n\nRight now, the Treasury yield curve is only inverted in the very front-end (from 1 month to 1 year) as rate cuts are still priced in for this year. After that, the curve starts to slope upward as: (1) the market prices in the next interest rate hiking cycle, and (2) term premium starts to increase, ie. investors demand a higher return for 'locking up' their money for longer. Under 'normal' economic circumstances, sovereign yield curves tend to be upward sloping.\n\nThe 2s10s Treasury curve has been steepening recently both as a result of  forward interest rates actually realizing, and more importantly due to fiscal woes. Uncle Sam runs a large budget deficit and this has to be financed by borrowing, resulting in the national debt increasing by $1 trillion every ~100 days. This means that the supply of bonds has to increase to facilitate increased borrowing and spending -- investors will demand a higher and higher term premium to absorb this increased supply. \n\nThe ongoing de-dollarisation theme also means that investors will demand an increased premium to hold longer-dated US Treasuries, further feeding the rise in term premium.\n\nYields curves globally have been steepening over the past 2-3 years as a result of similar dynamics, notable examples being Japan and the UK.",
