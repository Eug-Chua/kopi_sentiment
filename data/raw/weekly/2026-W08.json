As someone from a minority racial group i have met people with such a mindset and preferences when I was in spore but they r very closed minded, hv a lot of group think and r ignorntt so I can't click with them very well. It's disappointing that to a certain degree that I'm starting to feel the same way towards them.\n\nI thought that is fine but I realised after talking to them that they prefer to mix arnd with ang moh ppl. Like white locals when there r so many diverse races in San Fran. They would actually put it on insta to show that these ppl r their friends. It's absolutely SO cringe. In convos, they wld make passing remarks that makes me feel that they prioritise befriending ang moh white ppl. Like they would ask oh is your friend white?

I know I am and try to be mindful and not generalise but damn I won't wanna display it for the whole world to see. I just came to a realisation that it doesn't matter if we come from a multi racial and multi religious society and this whole facade of displaying diversity, even if we have that environment back home, we cannot force people to integrate and befriend other races even if we are conditioned to appreciate it through education. If they wanna shun or idolise a specific race, it is actually on them.\n\nI'm not looking for any advice because it is what it is but fellow sporeans overseas, have you met other sporeans like this?

I just wanted to express my disappointment that I thought by living overseas, we should open our minds and not 110% act on our prejudices overseas like how we did back home (for those who do).

I think most Singaporeans who move to SF are Chinese, from a privileged background, and like you say, may not have minority friends for the above-mentioned reasons. \n\nThere’s also the aspect of (someone else here mentioned this) of Chinese Singaporeans being somewhat absorbed quickly into the East Asian / AAPI model minority thing, even if we didn’t consciously participate in it. We are put in a box of ‘somewhere between a Chinese person from China and a Chinese American person’. Goes without saying that people perceive us as Chinese rather than Singaporean. And if you work in tech, it is absolutely a class thing. \n\nSF as a city is also overwhelmingly white and Chinese or other East Asian due to demographics and gentrification. Chinese Singaporeans also tend to bring our weird vibes about race here (I try not to ask many folks here I know about what they think about Black people.. coz I know the answer)\n\nIf you’re someone who never interrogated your own race / friendships back home, you probably won’t be someone who does that elsewhere. \n\nI think there are two broad groups of Singaporeans in SF: people who only hang out with other Singaporeans and can’t wait to get home, and these folks tend to be meet the profile you described, and everyone else. \n\nThe only joy I’ve had in the community has been through food networks and groups that are joint SG/Malaysian events or communities. They tend to be more diverse and open. Most of my friends are other immigrants from all countries, because I find that I connect more easily on that one large part of my life. \n\nAlso, ‘San Fran’ will earn you bad vibes here! \n\nI think over time that evens out a bit. My Singaporean friends who have been here more than a decade are very different people from who they are back home. Especially if they have kids and they are participating in more everyday life things, like school. Otherwise, if you’re working here in tech and that’s your entire life, then yeah, it is very white and other Asian. ",

Sad but true common experience. I am Chinese SGean, not religious, went to Chinese schools, so everyone I had significant social interaction with (i.e. people at school) was also Chinese. Certainly all my close friends were, except for one Chinese-Indian friend who transferred schools because she was having a shitty time there (e.g. being forced to enroll in Higher Chinese when she didn't even use the language at home. I hope as mixed families become more common in SG and Chinese standards fall that nobody else has that particular experience nowadays.) Do I now as an adult realize how cloistered my upbringing was? Sure. But anyway, I cannot change my past experiences, and neither can your friend.\n\nPart 2, your friend chasing angmoh. Remember the term sarong party girl? I think it's kind of odd behavior honestly that your friend is so obsessed with specifically befriending them to the extent of asking \"is your friend white\". ESPECIALLY in the Bay Area which like you said is so diverse. I don't agree with the other commenter that this is just a matter of seeking out other perspectives if your friend is both exclusively seeking out white friends AND avoiding Americans of other races.\n\n(A slightly kinder perspective: maybe something about your friend's angmoh friends is more comforting or welcoming or familiar? maybe they are running away from something? or seeking a specific community that happens to be white-dominated?)\n\nPart 3, have I met other overseas Singaporeans who are like your friend? Yes and no. People are different obviously, and people move overseas looking for different things. My hunch is that my specific history and personality have made me value diversity/openness much more than most other overseas Chinese Singaporeans I have met. Most. Not all. \n\nMaybe over time living in the US and becoming a minority will help develop your friend's empathy.

FESTIVE seasons, esp CNY is like the best time to earn extra. Its not like money vs relationship but more like I know from some of their responses that if I ever run into an emergency (choi!!) and needed help, there's low to no chance they will even help. They probably just generous with their naggings and judgements.\n\nIdk, some of you all might be close to your relatives and enjoy CNY but to me it's just a mad rush rat race kinda feel, we usually returned to work much more tired than usual day.

You often have to use broken English to communicate well with them. Some people really can't get used to it.\n\n4. The working hours start at 7.30am? But it also ends early la.

I was in a field role so I got the full deal of wearing a hard hat, coveralls and going up to the vessels such as rigs and FPSO etc. But I left in the end and I suggest you better leave this industry as well. Many reasons as below:\n\n\n- Safety. Saw an injury from an unintended discharge from a hydraulic line at 200-300 bar. Had a colleague who fell from a 3 storey height due to poor safety barriers erection by contractors. No amount of $$ can buy back your limbs or life.\n\n- Field work is tough and even tougher when you are older. I knew i didn’t want to be climbing up gangways or flare towers when I’m 40 plus.\n\n- Oil and gas is cyclical and I got laid off at another company when oil price crash. And given the green transition to renewable energies, this is a mega trend which is unstoppable. Oil and gas will play a smaller role in the future. \n\n- Your enemy is not AI but the decline of this industry in Singapore. This industry has been increasingly moving to other countries and we are now very far from the heydays where Keppel was renowned as a world leader for its B class jack up rigs and the yard were packed with ever increasing orders backlog and foreign workers. These days, the yards are very quiet. \n\n\nMarine vessels are dominated by Chinese and Korean yards. Rig building and vessel conversions is steadily declining in Singapore. Your future options are to move to these countries to work. Many oil and gas and marine contractors are now located in KL as their APAC HQ instead.\n\n\nYou can DM me, always happy to have a chat with someone who has worked in this industry that i have worked in before .",

Company bus is provided, but you reach the office before 7am because the company bus has other commitments or just wants to avoid peak jam. They also do not drop you door to door, you have to get picked/dropped at designated locations.\n\n3) Work environment - dangerous, dirty, smelly. You put on the PPE and helmet with safety glasses at all times on the site. Not sure about you, but I like to be clean and sip my coffee in front of a desk rather than roughing it under the sun and breathing in barnacle shit and paint fumes and dusts.\n\n4) Work place culture - toxic like f. It is all for yourself out there. Need somebody from other dept to help with coordination? Need to beg and see their face color. Your own boss /colleagues within same dept also gatekeep their knowledge so they can remain the guru while you navigate the politics and workflow by yourself. Basically shitty singaporean work culture.\n\nSo glad I left this hellhole and never looked back.

During one of my visits, I presented 2 mandarin oranges to a friend.

It didn't offend me, but it amused me and made me question myself something everyone has been doing for so long\n\n3. Colours and types of clothes during festive seasons. Many complain about the weather and hope for practicality but the elders insist on avoiding old clothes and certain colours. I've actually stopped buying new clothes for CNY for a very long time, but I still try to wear presentable clothes to avoid offending others when visiting\n\n4. Greatly reducing the amount of snacks and decorations bought for festive seasons, in the name of health and reducing environmental waste. My neighbour bought a brand new Xmas tree last year and just threw it out after Xmas ended.

By injecting monies into it, it creates a multipler effect onto the economy.  \n\nFor example, u build infrastructure such as rail-lines, roads and airports, u pump up the construction industry which will flow to the contractors and consultants and suppliers which increase demand for other goods, which then push the retail and finance industry and so on.  U attract foreign investment with better infrastructure and housing, which also leads to better stability which then leads to a cycle back to construction.  \n\nSo to what someone says, construction leads to better life all around (provided it doesn’t lead to over supply).",

      "selftext": "Context: My girlfriend is Burmese, and like many people back home, left the country amidst the military coup and political instability. She enrolled in private diploma course in Singapore, did an internship and subsequently went on to work for the company in the F&amp;B industry. We met while I did a gig job at the shop.\n\nHer company is a small shop with a focus on selling traditional desserts, located somewhere in central Singapore. They expanded to a secondary outlet but it closed down less than a year due to poor sales. The original outlet also suffered from poor sales and the owner failed to renegotiate a new lease, resulting in a relocation to a new location, where my girlfriend is currently at. In between the lease expiry and the set-up of the new location, my girlfriend did not draw a salary for about 2 months but was held on as an employee because the boss said \"don't worry I know going back to Myanmar is very difficult now\". I was initially grateful for the gesture but things turned bad.\n\nGF has been with the shop since the beginning, and you could say I am biased but she has been really diligent. On some days even when she was unwell, she refused to be on medical leave as it would be \"bad for the company and difficult for colleagues\". She gets one off day per week, which is common for F&amp;B. What I am concerned about are her working hours.\n\nBack at the original store, her shift is 1100-2300, with a 1-hour break. When she was selected to go to the second shop, her hours became 1000-2100, similarly with a 1-hour break. At the newest location, her work hours are 0700-2000, and while there's a 1-hour break on paper, she gets about 15-20 minutes to eat at most. That works out to be more than 72 hours per week. Her boss also recently informed that they will be unable to take an off day for 2 weeks as another Malaysian colleague will be on leave. I know this is a clear violation of so many MOM regulations, and I really want to confront the management on her behalf and write in to the relevant authorities, but I am really afraid of the backlash she might receive.\n\nShe has been applying for numerous jobs but was always met with \"sorry no quota\". As a Burmese, she requires a Work Permit (NTS) which means there must be a higher corresponding number of locals in the company before a Burmese van be hired. Additionally, there is a limit to the roles she can work, such as manufacturering, F&amp;B and housekeeping.\n\nDespite being with her shop for almost 3 years, her boss seems to favour 2 new Malaysian staff that was recently hired; giving them more authority and leeway compared to my GF and her other Burmese colleague. She is really very exhausted but looking for a new job is proving an uphill task and she is afraid to voice out to the current boss lest her work permit gets cancelled. An alternative would be to apply for a job via an agent, but I have been scrawling through the postings for the past few weeks and most of them are either similarly bad or worse off. Majority of the jobs posted provide a median salary of $1500 with either 1 or 2 off day the entire month. This is excluding a hefty agent fee of about $6000. Not sure how they exploit certain loopholes when it is clearly listed that workers on a WP should be paid a minimum wage of $2000.\n\nThank you for reading and any advice is greatly appreciated.",

I have volunteered with the Myanmar community and exploitation of Myanmar workers is more common because unlike workers from other countries, going home is not a real option for them. They have accrued massive debt just to get out and they risk not being able to get another passport, etc. This is why when they have to change jobs, they go to Thailand or Indonesia rather than go back to Myanmar. \n\n3. The problem is that any MOM investigation may lead to her wrongful termination. And yes, if she is fired, she is going to have to challenge that it was wrongful. This will cost money. In the mean time, she has no income, place to stay or even a valid permit to stay in the country. \n\n4. Even if she is not deemed to be a whistleblower, the risk of termination purely based on lack of money is real. \n\n5. OP  - at this point, you are aware of the harsh reality that she is in and the options are very limited. But your concerns are very real that she will work herself to death at this rate. Frankly, so many in Myanmar were eager to get out and agents exploit this with high fees and then leave them in terrible work situations. And Singapore sounds better for them compared to Malaysian and Thailand (also lots of Myanmar folks there) but we also have work conditions like this. \n\n6. Options I can see. \n\nA. Give feedback (through her and her colleagues), to the bosses that they cannot tahan. Yes, there is a risk but if the owner is smart, they also know they cannot work them to the bone. It is possible they continue with the conditions because they genuinely think that Myanmar people don't mind. \n\nB. Threat of escalation (through her or yourself) to MOM. This is a gamble, since it can definitely lead to retaliation. In this case, both need to be ready for work place retaliation as well as unjust firing. You may need to set aside funds/accom while she fights the case. \n\nC. Quit. Commit to finding another job in sg or overseas. This comes with a real risk of long term separation. \n\nD. Commit to marriage early. We should not take marriage lightly at all but if both of you are really sure that you want to be with each other, then it does ease a lot of the problems that you had on your mind. \n\n  \nGood luck bro.

ETA was 40 mins.\n\n\\- 12:56 AM: ETA pushed to 1:50 AM. No rider assigned.\n\n\\- 1:00 AM: Realized the restaurant was officially closed, but Grab wouldn’t let me cancel because it was “already being prepared.”\n\n\\- 2:46 AM: Food finally delivered.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the food was inedible. Cold fries, melted ice, and flat soda. We had to throw most of it away.\n\nI understand that CNY is a peak period with fewer riders, but the “cannot cancel” policy when an order is clearly stuck is borderline predatory. It also raises hygiene concerns; if the shop closed at 1 AM and I got the food at 2:45 AM, how long was it sitting out?\n\nHow should platforms like Grab and FP address this? Should there be an automatic “no rider” cancellation window?",

I can easily blank out completely and forget a conversation just that happened just a while ago (though I think is pretty common). Nontheless I thought a fast paced environment would help me to overcome these issues that I have been (still am) facing.\n\nI’ve been working for almost to 4 months, so there are certain expectations that people have of me.\n\nYesterday however, I was working a full shift. In the afternoon, I was not in the right state of mind. It was very heavy and hazy. This subsequently  affected my performance at night, despite me stationed at a position I’m very familiar with. I was so slow, pacing back and forth, and did many things wrongly. This was very unusual of me, even my coworkers realised. One of them asked me if I was okay since I seemed very stressed and not knowing what to do. At that point in time, I knew I messed up shitloads. But I still had to keep going.\n\nThat was when I was super unlucky. I accidentally cut myself with a staple bullet. I didn’t know the cut was deeper than a usual paper cut until blood started leaking on the receipts I touched. I was shocked. Those receipts were meant to be given to the customers. Thankfully though, those customers didn’t want a receipt from the start so I could keep the extra clean spare one. The problem though was that it didn’t stop bleeding for 10-15 minutes, and there were still a long line of customers who wanted to pay.\n\nBeing a cashier, you’d have to wipe the tables after helping customers to pay. Unluckily the two tables I had to wipe had pools of water customers accidentally spilled, which would take me much more time to clean. Moreover more and more customers wanted to pay, so I had to stop what I was doing and go back to the cashier.\n\nMy breaking point was when a guy ordered takeaway. He basically wanted to order a bottle of wine, but restaurant policy states that takeaway orders for wine would require customers to buy something else with it. I told him and he said he will consider. He came back and I double checked with him “So you want the red wine? A whole bottle?”, then he said, in a tone I’m not sure condescending “You mean we can order a glass of wine for takeaway”. This made me think about that one time I actually made this mistake when I was still new, so my voice just cracked and I started breaking down.\n\nLater on after closing, the same colleague asked me the same question, whether I was okay since tonight was extremely messy. This happened infront of two other colleagues. I didn’t mean to break down in front of them. I really didn’t. However, I kept thinking about my incompetence at work, how even after 4 months I couldn’t be as quick as my colleagues, and that I kept stammering. Coupled with flashbacks when my mother scolded me for being useless, incapable, and that she ultimately raised a pig. (She said this more than once). Moreover, when I’m stressed, I sometimes hear voices calling me, which makes me go crazy since sometimes I’ll walk up to customers asking if they needed anything, and my colleagues will see it as I’m walking back and forth. At that point, I just couldn’t take it anymore. I was incompetent to say the least. I was problematic and practically a burden. I wish I had the authority to deny, but looking at what’d I done, having my colleagues to resolve so many of my mistakes yesterday night, overwhelmed me with guilt.",

We are super lucky that he has not experienced any bullying at boarding school, in fact, there is hardly any believe it or not. If there is any, it is immediately dealt with by the school.

I only want to watch videos and game, but even then I can't even finish a movie without getting bored/distracted anymore.

I think it's affecting my health and progressively get more tired everyday despite not actually doing much work.\n\nI felt this wasn't an issue in my first 2-3 years of uni and internships, where I diligently did my stuff and even worked on side projects for my portfolio. Call me crazy but NS was genuinely the most motivated I've ever been, despite being lazy I never tried to avoid or delay doing work. It only happened in my final \\~1.5 years. Perhaps because the internships I did in that time was quite tiring and I found out I wasn't truly passionate about the work anymore, so everyday I just zoned out completely and heck care about work or studies. I stopped asking questions or being curious about learning new things.\n\nRight now I only look forward to overseas trips but that's only once every few months.

      "selftext": "from Sam Choo:\n\n“I felt like walking into a different country.”\n\nA few years before Covid, a minister shared that when he stepped into a lift, he heard people around him speaking in a language not his own. He said it was the first time he felt like a foreigner in his own country.\n\nBack then, I was working in the same area, serving one of the big banks. Every morning I would walk past a department with glass walls. One day I glanced in. Row after row of desks. Computer screens glowing. And every single person inside seemed to be from the same foreign country. It's like a foreign village planted into the room. \n\n \n\nYesterday, I read a post from a fellow Singaporean working in an office in the West. He said most of his colleagues were foreigners. They had their own lingo, their own inside jokes, their own favorite lunch spots. He found himself listening to conversations he could not quite follow. Smiling when everyone laughed, even when he did not fully get the joke. He said he felt like a minority in his own turf.\n\n \n\nWhen you sit in your own office and feel like the outsider, something shifts quietly inside your identity.  It is just a subtle dislocation. Like the furniture in your house has been rearranged and you are still trying to find the light switch in the dark.\n\nLast night, after dinner, I walked into the mall nearby. I had not been there since Covid. Same building. Same escalators. But it felt unfamiliar. Many of the shop signs were brands from one particular foreign country. I caught myself wondering where the local brands had gone.\n\nAnother day, my wife and I visited a neighborhood shop. The cashier could not speak English. We stumbled through the transaction. It was awkward.\n\nIn your workplace, do you ever feel like a guest in your own country?\n\nSome of us carry a quiet ache that is hard to explain. It is not about hating anyone. It is not about rejecting change. It is simply the feeling of being slightly displaced in a place you once knew so well.\n\nWe start asking ourselves, softly: Is this still my home?\n\nOr am I slowly becoming a minority in my own land?\n\nIt is a strange feeling to have.\n\nMaybe all I am really saying is this.\n\nI just want to feel at home.",

Singapore was left over as SEAbling. I guess it’s very real. What is Singapore and who are Singaporeans? That unique identity once proud is now eroded. Most Singaporeans are naturalized citizens (data not publicly given). Those pumping RON95 and giving a bad rep? PR/converts. SEA don’t really care what a Singaporean is because we don’t have an identify. We have Vietnamese, Malaysians, Filipinos, Indonesians all living here. Sg-Chinese? Sg-Malay? Sg-Indian? It’s not relevant anymore. \n\nSo what is a Singaporean exactly? Just a citizenship on paper and a passport I guess. Those left behind are neither Chinese nor Singaporean since we can’t exactly pin point what’s that. \n\nOur heritage? All artificially kept alive on life support. Just look at NDP and all the nostalgia stuff are very out of touch. Dragon playground? Gone a damn long time ago no one I talk to around me knows about sand playground. 5 stones? No one I talk to knows the game. PCK and under one roof nostalgia play? Just cringe (government gave them so much heat for creative expression our sitcom scene died with just a few hits). But now? Milk for nostalgia. \n\nI envy my SG-Malay friends. The culture is at least protected to some extent. They are minority but not withstanding the effect of PRC or India migrant culture erosion.

He’s the sweetest guy, super hardworking, and I love him to bits. Yesterday was the first time I went to his place for CNY reunion dinner. For context, I know that my family and his family has some SES differences, but I haven’t been bothered by it until yesterday.\n\nMy family stays in a landed home in District X. I knew he stayed in a 3-room HDB , but seeing it in person was a total culture shock.\n\nThe moment I stepped in, I felt so out of place. The house was so cramped, and the smell of cooking oil was everywhere because the kitchen is right next to the living room. His parents don't speak a word of English, only very loud, broken Hokkien/Mandarin.\n\nI tried my best to smile and use my limited Hokkien to communicate with them. I wanted to make a good impression, so I really dressed up. I wore a modest designer cheongsam (the lace one from SC brand) with some jewellery.\n\nI thought I looked respectful and  proper for the elders. However, this has bad fired badly. His dad was quite uncouth... throughout dinner, he kept staring at me. He made some comments in Hokkien like, \"Wah, your gf so 'swee,' body also very 'tok kong.' You better faster make her pregnant so she don't run away.\" Then he winked and made some hand gestures that made me feel so violated. Everyone else (including his siblings and mum) laughed like it was a normal joke, even my BF just chuckled and told him to eat more. I felt so cheap.\n\nNow I’m caught in a dilemma. I love my BF, but I’m thinking about our future. If we get married, my parents (who are very refined/particular about etiquette) have to sit across the table from a man who makes sexual jokes about his own daughter-in-law? I duno how both of our families can mingle in future. Now I feel so naive for thinking \"love conquers all.\" Is this what life is going to be like?

Locally born Singaporeans’ jobs have been affected. Many of the immigrants have also been granted PRs and citizenship without clear justification.\n\nThe unhappiness with immigrants is a natural reaction. It’s also displayed in Japan, Europe, Australia and Canada.\n\nI don’t think the general Singaporean is racist. Stop calling them that. This isn’t purely racism.\n\nYou cannot deny the general population’s anger when many people of different nationalities with fake degrees and bad cultural practices come over to take away jobs. You probably don’t feel it because you are retired.\n\nIt seems to me also that you don’t drive at all. It’s baffling how strong the impact of the car could be at that small road unless the driver was speeding and driving recklessly. You mean people are not supposed to feel angry about this?\n\nAnd go read the article carefully again: After knocking down the hapless child, her car moved again and rolled over the abdomen of her mother. Was it twice?\n\nWho drives like this?\n\nOh Bertha, you are saying people shouldn’t feel angry? You are such an angel hor. No apologies here, but we are humans here with emotions. We can’t fake it.\n\nAnd looking at the many photos, you mean you cannot interpret from the driver’s stance that she was not remorseful at all? Who the f would stand and gesticulate after fatally knocking down a young pedestrian and using the car to roll over the abdomen of her mother?!!\n\nOh oh… this was supposed to be merely an accident and that we should all calm down. Don’t get mad. It’s an honest human mistake. Doesn’t matter who is driving the car.\n\nGoodness. We don’t need a moral police here. You could have pivoted  your POV in a better way than try to reprimand people who trashed the driver.”",

The father’s heart-wrenching cries at the scene moved people across the island to grief for the family’s loss.\n\nYet even before police investigations were completed, social media had already launched a trial by public opinion against the driver. Some netizens narrated the incident in a tone resembling that of eyewitnesses, layering on vivid “details” through speculation and conjecture. In the process, they swiftly labeled the driver as “CECA.”\n\n“CECA” is the abbreviation for the Singapore–India Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement. In online discourse, it is also used to refer to new immigrants from India.\n\nAlthough those conducting this online trial may represent only a vocal minority, it is worth asking: when faced with such a heartbreaking accident, why do some people’s first instinct is to vent dissatisfaction toward a particular community?\n\nIt cannot be denied that the anger some netizens direct at “CECA” may reflect deeper anxieties—long-standing unease about immigration policies, social integration, and perceived disruptions to local ways of life. Such emotions deserve to be acknowledged, but they must not be expressed in this manner.\n\nIt should also be emphasized that the police have acted. The 38-year-old female driver has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by negligent driving. Claims that the authorities would “let CECA off the hook” are entirely baseless and serve only to inflame social divisions.\n\nAnother point of controversy concerns eyewitness accounts alleging that the driver, while speaking to the girl’s father at the scene, raised her voice and made a palm-up gesture while explaining herself. Some netizens interpreted this as arrogance or an attempt to shirk responsibility.\n\nThe Swiss-American psychiatrist Elisabeth Kübler-Ross proposed the “Five Stages of Grief” model to describe how people respond to death or severe trauma. Three of these stages are denial, anger, and bargaining. This framework may, at times, help explain the behavior of those involved in traumatic incidents.\n\nI was not at the scene, nor do I know any of the individuals involved. I have no intention of excusing negligent driving. However, the driver’s behavior at the accident scene might be interpreted through this lens.\n\nAs for what punishment she should receive, that must be determined by the law—not by destroying her character based solely on her identity, tone, or body language.\n\nAt the time of writing, the deceased has been laid to rest, and the injured remains hospitalized. May the departed rest in peace, may the injured recover swiftly, and may our society show a little more understanding and a little less hatred—so that emotional outbursts do not overshadow thoughtful reflection on the incident and accountability for it.\"",

You can Google for how to write a simple Will. You'll need to appoint an executor for your Will to handle the admin matters after you pass away so it's good to think of who this person is, and seek consent from this person. Then I believe witness to see you sign your Will and sign off as your witness is in order.\n\nPersonally I engaged a estate planner (which is essentially a FA which have their in-house legal team to draft the Will and their in house lawyer will act as my witness). The risk about diy is it might get contested in law should there be disagreement among the beneficiaries (or even non beneficiaries who feel they should be beneficiaries) of what you really mean in your Will, esp if they are not straightforward, or whether you were of sound mind when you wrote the Will. As my kids are still young (as is yours), my Will also includes a testamentary trust which my executor will need to enforce, that is, only a certain sum of living expenses is taken out from my estate annually for my minor children, until they reach a certain age then the remaining funds will be distributed to them).\n\nAnother thing you didn't mention is CPF nominations.

Preferably, take risk via your parents by borrowing from them paying them 2 percent returns (still better than FDs)\n9. Because your sums are so small.

Always remember, the dangers of leveraged ETFs..e.g flat market is where its dangerous like current USA markets. In 2008, its eerily similar before the crash. But crashes are fine for leveraged etfs, its the flat ones for long time that are bad.\n13. Once you reach 60k USD, time to sell and move to LSE.\n14. But you still need to SSO etf some what, thus tag to something else\n15. Only gold are power diversifiers, not perfect. Limit to no more than 30 percent if you are leveraging your equities with SSO or UPRO or TQQQ. TMF like any bonds are bad IMO. Otherwise, 5 percent. Gold is especially useful to solo CSPX only investors. If you are global indexer, you don't need as much.\n16. if all sounds too confusing. I personally tell my kids to only focus on risky etfs that make sense when you are very young and broke. i.e SSO + avuv / avdv + eimi. This is the global index value diversified high risk. If your amount is large, then IWVL on LSE.\n17. if wanna up the risk even more. Then apply relative momentum and review every month. i.e. only pick one. Current winner I believe its either avdv or eimi. I'll take avdv(small caps) or IWVL(large caps) if on LSE.\n18. If you kiasi, then dual momentum like I do. In fact, young should also dual momentum to some extent.\n19. always remember why diversification is so important. a 50 percent drop, takes 100 percent to recover. Never be stupid to think cuz you have long time frame. The bar has moved to greater than 20 years to what is considered long time frame. A pure USA even with long time frame can still end up Japan style multi decades crash.\n20. Don't think you are smarter than the market beta(it actually consists of small caps and mid cap too ).

Cash gets held as collateral while the CPF monies are being invested, then refunded after settlement. Takes longer to settle trades (T+5 working days) as opposed to Endowus.\n\n**Endowus**: carries the fund, no collateral requirement since CPF funds are drawn directly from CPF Board. But the I'm paying \\~0.35% all-in, which is like 7x the fund's own expense ratio just in platform fees.\n\nMy concern with POEMS is that I don't keep a large cash buffer by choice. I'd rather have my cash deployed instead of sitting as collateral for a CPFIS order, because that’s cash I can't use to buy opportunistically in IBKR. Other than that, the collateral window is only a few days but having a longer settlement period during market downturns actually matters to me. There’s also the matter of the minimum investment size which causes odd lots in POEMS, but that’s another topic.\n\nAm I missing anything that carry Amundi funds for CPFIS?

Over a long period of time, I am surprised that CPF balance can be quite substantial. It doesn't feel much on a month by month basis but if you work for a long time, it can be significant.\n2. FRS will continue to grow and hence this is something to take note of. \n3. For BHS cap, if we were to assume that is the amount to target to ensure proper health coverage, it seems quite a challenge to hit it as well i.e. meaning one might have to have cash or insurance to address any unforeseen medical issue.\n4. Reaching FRS is doable but ERS is a different thing. You are likely not going to hit it unless you do active topping up. What are your thoughts? Would you try to go for ERS for the higher monthly payout.\n5. Delay CPF Life payout might increase the payout by a few hundreds but I am not sure if it worth the delay. Would you start your CPF life at 65 or later.\n6. My expense maybe on the high side because I realized CPF Life only contribute to less than 50% of expense. I am not sure if there is so called a \"target\" since everyone life style is different. How much does CPF life payout covers your expenses? I have peers that can cover up to 80% of their expenses.\n\n  \nHope you find this useful and would like to hear your thoughts as well!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lrleibmy9gkg1.png?width=1219&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc3152229a79b7829fa27d042010d8c39b04dede\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xcgnh0v1agkg1.png?width=1226&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d7e2742dfbd748c18aa9d6789172280d3875365\n\n",

          "text": "This is my take on CPF LIFE. \n\nThe scheme is primarily a longevity insurance, with the key point on it being an insurance at the end of the day. People who focus on ‘breakeven’ ages and how to profit the most from it are missing the point - you don’t buy hospitalisation insurance and calculate how many times you have to get warded for it to be worth it, you don’t buy term insurance and say it’s worth if you die before X years old, so you shouldn’t be saying CPF LIFE is worth if you live to Y years old. You ‘buy’ into it for the insurance aspect and not to profit from it (because statistically you will not).\n\nNow while it’s not like term or CI insurance where you can explicitly choose a dollar amount to buy, the choices you have in the scheme determines the coverage of this ‘longevity insurance’. \nNamely, in increasing order of coverage \n1) BRS (pledging property)-&gt; FRS -&gt; ERS\n2) Basic -&gt; standard -&gt; escalating withdrawal plan\n3) how delayed the payouts start after age 65\n\nFor most, BRS to ERS is obvious but why is escalating and delayed considered a higher coverage? Because you’re paying a higher cost now to get a larger future payout (protection), the same way you would pay more for a term insurance with a higher sum assured.\n\nSo if you want the least coverage in this insurance, you go for BRS + basic + immediate start whereas the ‘highest’ coverage (meaning the most protection against living long) would be ERS + escalating + delay to 70.\n\nSo naturally the question is how much coverage do you need? Higher coverage is not always good since you’re paying more for it as well. For term or CI insurance, there are guidelines like 5x income but from what I know CPF doesn’t give much guidance on _how_ to choose between the options, they just present the facts to you and let you decide. \n\nTo me, the higher your net worth the less you need longevity insurance, since the chance you outlive your money pot is smaller. So if you’ve not much saved for retirement, max out CPF and go for the ‘highest’ coverage. Whereas if you have 10M then you really don’t need any longevity insurance and you should go for the minimum.",

I believe this gives a better Breakeven age.\n\nbut in any case the Breakeven ages are beyond life expectancy by design. of course policymakers advise against fixating on Breakeven age, but policymakers have different goals in mind than individuals.  basically the few of you who live beyond expectation will be paid via the interests from everyone else who don't earn any interest from their personal sums beyond the age of 65 (or 70).so do your own due diligence with regards to this information.\n\nas for me, I see no point in participating beyond the bare minimum when statistically I have at least 30 years from 55 to death to have any extra funds growing outside the CPF system which is a long enough duration to expect better gains even with the higher volatility. this way I think I can win whether I die before or after expectation. but I know I can hit FRS easily and will not be fully dependent on CPF Life so that's my case, so again do your own DD.",

The biggest differences in balances (from projections) are employment income, housing deductions and investments. \n\nYour first target should be to hit the Basic Healthcare Sum, then Full Retirement Sum. So long as you're always at or above the median income for graduates of your cohort, you will certainly reach FRS in SA - by 40 if you max out BHS by 28. Much earlier if you also topup your SA / do OA transfers (neither are recommended in my opinion due to ringfencing). I personally do not recommend ERS for those with liquid assets of between 1-3M in retirement. It is fine for those with less (meaning they were never able to amass sufficient assets hence hints at lack of ability) or more (ERS is insignificant).\n\nI would not base my retirement income solely on CPF Life: too much concentration risk. My retirement income pillars would likely be: CPF OA (15-20%), CPF Life Basic - BRS (5-10%), rent (20-30%), SRS (10-15%) and cash investments (remainder) and at any time, always 50-100k in cash or equivalent for emergencies. \n\nIt is also important to account for inflation which is why most of my retirement income sources would have some form of inflation peg. CPF Life, even the escalating plan, would see real retirement incomes shrink over 20-30 years (when payouts start at 65 till the likely life expectancy age of 90+ for my cohort). Meaning a 3k CPF Life payout today would only be worth 1k in 30 years, something that many don't consider since they don't do proper retirement planning anyway.",

At 4% interest rate, your money is doubled after waiting about 18yrs.\n\nThe power of forced savings is amazing too. CPF Board forces us to save 20% of our income, and then my mother forced me to save another 20% of my take-home pay in a 20yr savings endowment plan. Both of these pay relatively low interest rates 2 - 4% but because capital is guaranteed so no complaints. The best benefit here is forced to save up no need to apply self-discipline.\n\nThe above 2 methods of growing wealth are suitable only for people who doesn't take any risks and who doesn't wish to seek greater yields in other investment vehicles.\n\nI am below 55 so currently I only top-up the amount that CPF Board allows me to (8k or less each year) for the purpose of tax relief. I also top-up $15,300 into SRS also for the purpose of tax relief.\n\nOnly after I have fully paid up my flat then I grew a pair of balls (joking lah, I am still an auntie, did not turn into an uncle) and I started learning about stocks, unit trusts and index funds. The balls I grew are not that big, so I did not venture into Cryptocurrency or Options (but hor I have more gutsy real uncle friends who are into these 2 lehhh).\n\nEhh wait, sorry I sidetracked too much already. Back to the question of ERS. Do I think after my 55th birthday I will want to actively top-up CPF RA to hit ERS? In the past, when I only knew 2 methods of growing wealth that time, I will say yes. Now I will say no. Cash is still king, you can decide what you want to invest in freely without restrictions. If you loved Apple you can go buy Apples, if you love Alphabet you can go and buy Alphabets, and, if you can't decide which of the top companies got the most growth potential you can just buy S&amp;P500 index funds.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, CPF Life payout ($1000+) should only form a small portion of retirement income because CPF Life payout is enough to live on but not enough to have a life. Confusing? What I mean is you will have enough sustenance and surely won't die of hunger but you won't have a vibrant existence (imagine no overseas holidays and no regular fancy restaurant meals).\n\nAbout CPF Life payout adequacy and your high expenses, I will reassure you by telling you that you don't need to lose sleep over it because humans are highly adaptable intelligent beings. There is the opposite of \"lifestyle creep/inflation\"; call it \"lifestyle uncreep/deflation\" if you will. I give you 2 real life examples:\n\n1) My father is a gambler (Singapore Pools is his best friend) and saved up $0 of his $5k monthly income. At retirement, all he got is CPF savings because thank you CPF Board stopped him from gambling away CPF RA. He is now retired and living on CPF Life $900/mth. My sister and I help him by paying for his maid's salary and expenses, we don't give him cash because Singapore Pools is still his best friend.\n\n2) My ex-colleague used to live a high life travelling the world, buying luxury goods and eating at fancy restaurant regularly and she also saved up $0 of her I-dunno-how much monthly income. At retirement, she was so worried that she can't survive without work but she had worried for nothing.
