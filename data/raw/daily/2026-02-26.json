It is noted that certain currently airing titles will be delayed for a week before released for free viewing (members gets exclusive rights to watch the show upon release)\n\n\n\n**Mewatch Streaming Platform:** [https://www.mewatch.sg/series/anime](https://www.mewatch.sg/series/anime)\n\nSome of Ani-One's members only content are available here for free streaming, such as Kaiju No 8, Solo Leveling and My Hero Academia: Vigilantes\n\nIn addition, Mewatch also hosts some titles that are unavailable on Youtube from Muse Communication such as Wind Breaker\n\n  \n**Important things to take note:**\n\nKindly note that titles under Mewatch may expire approximately 1 to 2 years after they first appeared on the platform, the titles will start to countdown once they reach approximately 30 days left to expiry, also, some titles under Muse Asia may be removed from Youtube on short notice when their license period is expiring (usually with a few days left before removal), so try not to procrastinate if you see a title that you want to watch\n\nKindly note that **NOT** all titles under Ani-One Asia and Tropics Entertainment Asia are free to stream, some titles under Ani-One Asia and Tropics Anime Asia are members only which requires paying for membership",

Nothing objectively wrong with it. But somewhere along the way I realised I was just going through the motions. Comfortable, yes. Fulfilled… not really. I kept telling myself I should be grateful, which I was, but that didn’t stop the dread on Sunday nights.\n\nI recently decided to change things up in a pretty big way. I’m moving to Bangkok for a new job and a new environment. Different industry, different country, different pace, different version of myself. It’s not like my old life was bad. It just wasn’t the life I wanted to keep repeating for the next 10 years.\n\nYou’re 23. Two years since graduating is nothing, I promise. It feels like a big gap because your adult life has only just started, but in the grand scheme it’s tiny. People pivot at 25, 30, 40. \n\nAlso, starting “from zero” isn’t really zero. You’ve worked full-time. You know what an office feels like. You’ve learned what drains you.  But every path has trade-offs. Office life trades your weekdays. Shift work trades your schedule flexibility. Uni trades income for time and potential long-term upside. There’s no perfect option, just different costs. \n\nAlso, remember that doing nothing is also a choice. I think the bigger question isn’t “is it too late?” It’s “if I stay exactly where I am for the next five years, how would I feel?” That question hit me hard when I was deciding whether to uproot my life and move countries. 23 is the perfect age to experiment a bit.

If you don't know what to do now, you don't know what to do later. School isn't going to give you the sudden realization of a path to take. Look at how many JC students go into uni only to come out still gormless. There is nothing wrong to start from 0 but the problem is you have to know why you want to start from 0 or else you would wake up one day, ask yourself why are you even suffering and have no answer to stop feeling like shit.

They first focused very heavily on agriculture output (mostly rice) since they had a massive peasant population. So crop output soared and enabled them to rapidly gain GDP in the 50s/60s which created the “Taiwan economic miracle”.\n\nHowever there is a limit to primary sector growth, which they soon reached and had to diversify the economy into the secondary sector. Taiwan attempted to do the Singapore approach and invite massive amounts of FDI and companies to setup shop there to boost the manufacturing sector which was still focused on low value goods (eg textiles), but this never amounted to much (at least until the more recent electronics era).\n\nFor decades they never attracted any large international MNCs, so technology transfer and productivity gain for the workforce was limited. And they even lost their own local companies which moved their operations overseas to China and SEA. There were many successful manufacturing SMEs for electronics, machinery parts and chemicals, but most of these never developed into large multi-billion companies. TSMC was around to lead the charge, but it’s still just 1 blockbuster company alone.\n\nTo this day Taiwan still lags behind in the banking, services and healthcare sectors compared to Singapore (though they are still very successful in these). These sectors are the mass wealth-generation engines of the modern global economy, so it’s natural for them to have lower productivity.

Currently my main source of learning is using Duolingo (Bahasa Indonesian). It's not completely the same as Malay but I do not really have other alternatives. Currently I know some vocabulary and able to form short sentences, e.g. Saya suka belajar Bahasa Melayu.\n\n  \nI have signed up for physical class to learn Malay at onePA but the teacher is very bad at teaching such that the class attendance rate went from 15 people at the start to only 5 now including me. Other Malay classes are just too expensive for me; I can't afford them.\n\n  \nSo I am thinking of learning from textbooks and workbooks once I finished Duolingo syllabus. I tried to find textbooks and workbooks in Singapore's Popular bookstores but I can only find assessment books which are not what I want.\n\n  \nAre there any materials such as textbooks/guidebooks/workbooks for beginners like me? I know there is Malay Special Program offered to secondary non-Malay students, but I can't find the entire Sec 1 to Sec 4 syllabus for sale. If anyone has them, I am willing to buy them at discounted prices. (Not working at the moment)\n\n  \nLastly, can anyone share what is the best way to learn Malay on my own? I tried conversing Malay with my teacher but I just can't understand what he is saying. He talks too fast and i don't understand his words at all. It just seems impossible to have a conversation.\n\n  \nThank you and have a nice day.",

It's usually simple sentences with repetition. So you can remember the new words they introduce. Carousell may have some second hand but that depends on your luck, I think. Malay is quite easy to read so that shouldn't be a barrier, just focus on the comprehension part.

Then use the tricks in [my making vocab stick video](https://youtu.be/gBEpJPQeq8o?si=V6mQuaKgyxz20C2f), specifically setting up Anki and dumping your vocab in there. Something I didn't cover in the video but is enormously helpful: learn how to use Cloze Cards in Anki for sentence structure.\n\nIf you practice daily with Anki and add just 20 to 100 words a week, you'll be surprised how quickly you can get to fluency. It's a lot more fun than sitting in class with a teacher just talking at you, and more likely for it to stick. The hard part is to be consistent and stick with it. It doesn't matter if you do things perfectly, what matters is that you make just a little bit of progress daily and don't stop.\n\nIf you don't have native speakers around who can help you, look on Preply or on some of the Malay subs here. Also check r/languagelearning for more resources.\n\nGood luck!",

Modelling CPF LIFE + SRS Scenarios : r/singaporefi](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/1rcgb7l/comment/o78n1o1/)\n\nNow I’m wrestling with something new: **dividends.**\n\nI currently have different investment pots:\n\n* ETFs (mainly growth-focused)\n* US stocks\n* SG dividend stocks  (accumulated over time) and non dividend stock (early years mistakes)\n\nFor overall portfolio growth, it’s straightforward to assume something like X% annual return.\n\nBut dividends are different.\n\nFor some of my SG stocks, I’ve been accumulating specifically for dividend income. I haven’t been disciplined about tracking them, but I know I receive dividends across various months each year.\n\nWhich leads to a few questions:\n\n**Should dividends just be modeled as part of total return?**\n\nOne approach is to assume my entire portfolio grows at X%, and treat dividends as already embedded inside that. It is simple but it hides the fact that dividends are actual cash inflows.\n\n**Or should dividends be modeled explicitly as passive income?**\n\nAnother approach I’m considering:\n\n* Allow tracking of actual dividends received per stock so that at least i have a sense what have i been getting.\n* Aggregate them to see my historical annual dividend income.\n\nBut then the tricky part is how do I project it forward?\n\nDo I use the aggregated amount vs the total portfolio of the dividend stocks and use it to calculate the return? Or good enough to just assume a fix $Y per year amount of passive income?\n\n**Retirement Strategy**\n\nIf you’re holding dividend stocks for retirement:\n\n* Do you ever liquidate dividend stocks?\n* Or are they psychologically a “never sell” bucket?\n\nI’m trying to understand how people here actually think about this in practice.\n\nI would love your thoughts so that I can see what works and then implement this in the free tool and hopefully this dividend feature is also useful for everyone (or at least for newbies like me).\n\nThanks!",

(what happens after they sell? when do they sell? How frequently do they sell?. ) So it might still help with retirement planning for someone to guesstimate how much of their retirement expenses would be funded from a 'safer' income source of dividend vs selling of other assets, but take note this is more for mental comfort, and it shouldn't change too much on how financial projection is typically done. What we can do is to figure out what the users want to see, and allow the app to show it to them (and maybe guide them to the 'better approach')  \n\\- portfolio projection based on mean return over the long run is not really realistic, and this is amplified by dividend stock picking, less so if you're using dividend stocks ETF.   \n\\- dividend stocks ETF are really not that different from growth stocks ETF, the differences being they have lower expected return, and with lower standard deviation (more stable)\n\n  \nwith these in mind,  \nif i were to approach this specific dividend problem/feature in my tool, I'd probably introduce a 'dividend income' feature where the users can specify how much of their portfolio is invested in these 'dividend bucket', which is treated like any other asset in projection.   \n  \nbut the model would allow user to decide how much of the 'total return' of this bucket comes from capital gain, and how much of it come from dividend income\n\nfrom there they can have an 'estimated dividend income' (really not that useful if you're 28 years old trying to project a company's dividend 23 years later, but you might be able to make it slightly more useful by introducing toggle to switch between base case, optimistic, pessimistic estimation) and calculated expenses.  \nthen they can figure out if they 'feel safe' with said portfolio allocation\n\n\n\nAgree with what the other commenter said, you should focus on overall generation of wealth in your portfolio allocation (especially if you're younger and have the time on your side). As dividend portfolios have lower expected return + lower std dev, one the industry recommended practices for passive investors to maximize return over long timeframe is what they call glide path portfolio: Where you start young with more exposure to asset with higher expected return (growth stocks), then as you grow older you gradually increase the weightage of assets with higher stability but lower expected return (bonds? blue chip dividend stocks?)\n\nSo when building this tool, you have to ask yourself what problem are you trying to solve, and for who? Is it:  \n\\- automated cost basis reduction for users like [Savings\\_Enthusiasm60](https://www.reddit.com/user/Savings_Enthusiasm60/)?  \n\\- other users that see dividend as income to be spent(and thus doesn't reduce the cost basis)  \n\\- already retiring user who want to see how much of their projected expenses can be covered by dividend?  \n\\- 30 years old user planning to retire at 55 years old deciding how much they should allocate to safer asset?  \n\\- people who just want to play around with the number, as they already have a glide path portfolio decided but wondering if they need to fine tune it?  \n\\- people who never sell their dividend stocks (even if it's value trap)  \n\\- people who trades dividend stocks like they do any other asset  \n\\- people who buys dividend stocks for dividend, but never tracks the dividend?\n\nAnd more importantly, what are you trying to solve for yourself?   \nAll these can be valid use case, but you have to decide what you want to build? is it a portfolio allocation guidance tool? a dividend visualizer?\n\nsorry for the long wall of text but hope you find this useful for your build going forward",

I’ve learned my lesson and I’m committed to changing, so I’m trying to sort everything out properly now.\n\nI’ve already applied for DRS and I’m currently waiting for the Official Assignee to assess whether my application will be approved.\n\nAt the same time, I’m planning to apply for HFE, and I’m worried about how my DRS application might affect my eligibility for an HDB loan.\n\nFrom what I understand, DRS covers unsecured debts, while an HDB loan is considered a secured loan. I’m unsure whether being under DRS (if it gets approved) would impact my HFE assessment or HDB loan approval.\n\nHas anyone here been in a similar situation?

IG is a decent sized company and MAS regulated, so I don't think it's drastically unsafe, although of course IBKR has further to fall and is more familiar in this market. I don't think IG is too hopeful that people will use IG markets as a gateway to their CFD products, they have put a lot of separation between the two so it seems that they're trying to look like they're avoiding a connection beyond the brand.\n\neToro is another relatively newly launched alternative in Singapore, which IMO has the nicest app, but it doesn't have the commission and interest benefits of IG markets, plus you will lose money when transferring in as they use a bad exchange rate for SGD deposits, or you need to deposit in USD which will likely still have some fee.

Just going to drop some facts - they dont really talk about risk, for example all of them will spam entries with different lots, even doubling the lots when they lose (Revenge trading), but the thing is you don’t know how much they lose when they lose and how much they win when they win in-terms of profit/loss in dollars. All they show is their win rate and their pips movement. So for example they might put TP at 1x (100pips) and SL at 1x too, however when it hits 10 pips they count it as a win already, and the “results” they show will be the highest the candle went, for example if the candle went to 100 pips they will show 100 pips earned, but their total profit from that trade might only be 20 pips (Due to take partials/closing early etc). The winrate as a result is inflated and the earnings they show in pips is also inflated, as in they only show the highest the trade went which might not be what they earn (as they might have closed early or even break even). This results in them maybe “winning” 5 trades in a row and losing one but still resulting in negative profits. Also they spam the entries so you dont have a fixed risk (how much u lose per trade) and also not a fixed tp, that may result in 1 loss wiping out all your earnings. Like you said they earn from comms so that might be why they spam entries and ask people to do that too. Bottom line is that might not even be profitable but just show the highest tick the trade went, and inflated WR due to counting everything as a win even if it went up by abit (They might be negative due to one loss wiping everything out even if they have a super high WR). (Real profit loss is not shown and everything is counted as inflated pips/WR). Be careful as this might be a business model to gather a community for revenue via comms/topup rather than really trading for a revenue.",
