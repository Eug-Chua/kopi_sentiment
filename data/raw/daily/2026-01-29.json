Here's how can fix this though. The trick to making friends is three things. 1. Showing up at the same place again and again where you meet someone. (Can even be league of legends) 2. Asking them questions and doing their activity and seeing if they reciprocate. 3. Being vulnerable, showing your true self, and telling them something sensitive. Make plans and initiate, and keep repeating until something forms. it is a numbers game. I am an ambiverted person but even for me it's very difficult to socialise in Singapore. For eg I made the same number of friends I have in Singapore in Malaysia in 5 days. That's how conserved we are. Do not care if they are men or women or anything accept them and be respectful and try to have fun with them. People love when you allow space for them to exist in your world and then shown your world. Not the other way around. You have already made one step of being vulnerable about this, if i can help would love that :)",

For some, it can be travelling the world and seeing new things. For me, I am happy enough when I can have my favourite Bak Chor Mee in the evening. My opinion is that in the end, you are the one who puts meaning in your life. For the rich, maybe having a 3 star michelin meal still cannot make them happy. So if you dont define that meaning yourself, you will feel mundane and in a loop. And honestly, even when you do derive meaning, the feeling of being in a loop wont magically disappear, but it will just feel a little easier. Happiness in itself is not a forever feeling. Our emotions flunctuates, and I think learning to regulate our emotions ,plus reflection and having the feeling of gratitude in our lives, will make things just a little easier. You are fortunate enough to be married to your partner, to own a house with her, to live life with her. There will be more struggles and challenges to come, but everything will happen for a reason, sometimes not to what we like, but it will happen regardless. Hope you can figure things out OP.",

In the meantime, as it was a weekend, getting clearance to contact his family officially was harder from the embassy side and therefore I assisted in finding family members through his social media. We managed to get a few people in contact and his nephew came down to settle the case. For the house tenancy agreement, cause of death was part of the agreement so half of the deposit was forfeited and half was refunded by his landlord. Salary: Was paid till the day he passed away with a small bonus. Deposited to his bank account. Bank account: Had more than 5 figures inside and hence a lawyer was needed due to the banks Terms and Conditions. It took around 8 months and around 9k SGD of lawyer fees to get the amount transferred to my friends siblings accounts. Singapore based online investments: Only after the phone was unlocked, they found a few hundred thousand $ worth of investments. After using Turkish lawyers to talk to the companies, funds were transferred to his Singapore bank account which was bounced back, and then with another court order it was transferred to Turkiye with high costs due to the official process. Body transfer to Turkiye from Singapore had cost around 9k SGD including post mortem and Singapore Muslim Casket assistance. Most of the basic stuff took 3 days to complete but the most difficult ones were the bank and investment payouts. My friend didnt have a will, didnt have any marriages or kids. Therefore it was harder to get his work done. But may he rest in peace and know that it has all been settled.",

Their work culture was like a “family” as they call it, with christian quotes written on some boards. Didnt enjoy it as an introvert due to the environment which prioritised socialising>work quality, but that’s just me. We had to attend weekly meetings, which was often hosted by Melvin Lim, and got paid $800 per month as mentioned by the redditor who disclosed everyone’s salaries. Late fee of $10 applicable to interns as well if late for meetings, money requested by events team which goes to pantry supplies. The best thing from this scandal is Marc filling in as Interim CEO.

Focus is on income, as opposed to capital growth, and on liquidity.\n\nSpoke to a RM from one of the major banks here a few months ago who, knowing what I was looking for, pushed me to sign up to a ILP on the whole amount, with no liquidity, no monthly returns and high surrender fees. Although I am not financially literate, I can smell BS from a mile off. I actually walked out of the room.\n\nI looked through the Newbie section of this sub, which is great. Whoever spent days writing that deserves a medal.\n\nI am not financially literate. I am not looking for predictions. Rather, I am looking for passive low risk income such as the above, with liquidity. Is it wise to put it all in bonds e.g., PIMCO, or a bond-focus fund, a money market fund, or should I include equities? Or should I just speak with an IFA?\n\nFor me, going to a bank is a chore and I have no interest in bank perks such as dining offers and airport lounge access.

Or at least it isn’t a complete waste of money compared to if you had less. IFAs are often not fee-based, they just sell multiple insurance company products and earn commission, so make sure you don’t use this type. Endowus is a very decent mix of user-friendly with acceptable fees. IBKR is cheapest for many things (including Pimco GIS Income Fund) but not so easy to use. The Pimco GIS Income Fund is a ”bond-focus fund”. The bonds inside are a bit more risky and somehow they use some leverage, so the payouts are higher. There are slightly different “flavours” as well, like Pimco GIS Diversified Income Fund. Money market fund is very safe, but the returns are under 1.5% p.a. now so it won’t help you meet your goal of ~5% p.a. in “dividends”. And don’t get tricked into USD mmf with higher interest because the FX risk will just get you instead. Other products that I think could help you are 1) Allianz Income and Growth (can get thru Endowus for lower fees). This is about 1/3 US equities and 2/3 bonds, but the bonds are the riskier type and half perform more like equities. Read this for a more thorough explanation of pros and cons: https://investmentmoats.com/fund/allianz-income-growth-good-returns-for-past-3-years-sustain-7-income-yield/ 2) Amova Singapore Dividend Equity Fund (can’t  buy directly from Endowus, but you can buy from Poems or Dollardex then transfer to Endowus, and Endowus will let you buy more after that).  This is composed of Singapore stocks and gives out 5% p.a. dividends monthly while doing a pretty good job of maintaining or growing capital. A bit less bank-heavy than the Straits Times Index, and you pay higher fees but they solve the monthly payout problem for you. S-REITs also inside, so it’s good for “dummies”. People will probably tell you to invest in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for the lowest fees, but then you need to sell to create your “dividend”, and it requires more financial literacy.

Yield is high for all classes but is also because it doesn't take into account hedging cost.

Long story short, NAV likely to erode, your 6% dividend net of fees and hedging cost, is typically closer to 3%, assuming spreads stay tight and yields are constant On AIG the dividend yield stated is not an organic yield. The organic yield of the fund is closer to 2+ 3%, due to its mix of HY bonds, convertibles and equities that are ALL US centric.

If mainstream FI are finally recommending gold, it’s going to get crowded. But to hedge against currency debasement you’ll need gold. Holding just equities is not enough. Because there is a regime change. Understand what the US is trying to do. The US debt  and the interest on their debt is unsustainable. They need to lower interest rates. The fed can cut rates but that will only influence rates on the short end of the bond yield. They can’t control the long end. One idea that’s been floated is to allow the USD to devalue. But devalue against what?  They can allow it to devalue against gold. At the US treasury, gold has a statutory price of $42+. This was set in the 1970s and they have not revalued this. What treasury could do is to revalue gold, mark it to market and suddenly the treasury has “free” money, which they can sell to the Fed. Fed prints the dollars. This is just accounting to give the US treasury new “money”. In addition to this, the Genius act which allow private companies to issue stable coins that are backed by treasuries is a natural buyer of short duration bonds and bills. This helps keep the short term borrowing cost down. But the clarity act allows these stables coins to generate yield. companies like Tether are taking these yields and buying gold. Tether has one of the largest non-nation entity holding gold. Guess what the US government could do? They could ask Tether to back (buy) US long duration treasuries with their gold thus making US treasuries gold-backed. This would massively devalue the US currency but allow them to control yield at the long end, meaning they can borrow at a lower rate. In the end bond holders suffer and a massive transfer of purchasing power go to holders to gold Central banks were already sniffing this eventuality out years ago. Even Singapore has started increasing our gold reserves. 100% equity is not it anymore. That worked well 25-30 years ago. The regime has changed. How you invest must also adapt.",

But there must be a distinction to be made here that the allocation is part of portfolio construction right from the start, instead of having gold allocation just because you want to jump on the hype train. According to the modern portfolio theory, investors are compensated with higher expected returns only by taking on additional systematic risk. However, this total portfolio risk can be optimised by adding uncorrelated asset classes. This allows an investor to reduce overall volatility without necessarily sacrificing the portfolio's expected return. Historically, gold has maintained very low correlation to equities (between 0 to 0.3). This means that gold's price movement is largely independent of the stock market. This improved stability results in better sharpe ratio, signifying higher return per unit of risk taken. In terms of portfolio rebalancing, having a predetermined allocation also allows you to invest in the \"cheaper\" asset. For example, my target allocation for gold in my portfolio is 10%. As of the most recent price movement, my gold allocation has surged to 11%. This allows me to avoid putting more money into gold (since it is overweight and \"expensive\") and channel my incoming funds into the relatively \"cheaper\" equities instead.",

I’ve been working for less than a year, as I was studying overseas for the past couple of years. I’ve got about $50k in savings and $5k in investments (mainly ETFs and DBS/UOB). I see posts here about people much younger than myself having $200k + in savings which makes me feel broke… (I know comparison is the thief of joy but I think I come from a ‘better to do’ family so I’m wondering how people can have saved so much at such a young age? Im not jealous, I’m happy for them but just wondering what the source of money is and how I’m so behind? Is it purely because I’ve only started working recently?)\n\nInstead of letting the $50k just sit there I was looking for some advice on what to invest in. I want to DCA into ETFs but I feel like the market is at its peak and will crash soon, (yes I know time spent in the market beats timing it), but I can’t bring myself to buy any more stocks / ETFs seeing the peak we’re at and also seeing what trump is doing, I think the market will correct soon as investor confidence gets shaken?\n\nThank you so much and any advice is appreciated (-: I hope everyone has a lovely rest of the week!",

And besides, I’m in my late 20s (same as you) and I will tell you right now that money isn’t everything yet becausethe greatest investment you can make is in yourselfat this stage of life. You aren’t even earning in your prime yet 🤣 It is perfectly okay to spend money to invest in yourself if you can reap the rewards in the future. For me, I used to work in a good $6.5k job and I decided to blow 50k to get myself a local postgrad. Was the money wasted in the sense that I set myself back on this milestone? Yeah, I agree with that and the content I learnt in my postgrad can be learnt online, but nobody told me that by investing in myself this early, people will see me as a postgrad for the rest of my working life and will offer me a $11k job upon graduation Don’t think so much about whatever that orange buffoon is doing and just focus on yourself. Control the things you can and you’ll find yourself surprised to be sitting in the shade you have planted years ago. I buy index and save a good portion of my salary in it because I don’t like to think too much and just want my money to grow decently while I focus on myself and my subsequent milestones in life That, or you can go all in for tomorrow’s $10M TOTO draw.

As for which ETFs to invest into, the standard for this sub is VWRA for irish domiciled + large sum + world index. However, for myself I do a mix of SWRD (89%) + EIMI (11%) as EIMI should add additional small cap exposure which should do better over a long term, but honestly the difference compared to VWRA is so minimal, and you really need >5-10 years to really see the difference and you do need to rebalance the percentage of developed market to emerging market. Others have suggested  ACWD for a kind of one fund and forget type but incurs lower TER as compared to VWRA. But honestly, all the numbers are meaningless as compared to actually just investing. You need to not experience paralysis by choice and pick one strategy and stick with it.",

People want to sell, people want to avoid investing. End up what, they miss the best time to buy, the market quickly recovered and these same people missed out on ALOT of gains.
