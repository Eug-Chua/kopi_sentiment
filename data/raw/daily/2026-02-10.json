Since it's perceive as safe place, money flows throughout the economy (at first residential properties then ABSD kicks in, then industrial properties, heritage properties district and as of recent banks lending to leasing companies for COE).\n\nBased on historical trends local stock market didn't get much love and look by the affluent overseas investors who parked their AUM here. The areas that got looked at was Banks, REITS and property developers. DBS was the crown-jewel.\n\nSo those funds brought in by the banks only \"recycle\" into hard-physical assets controlled by the government because they know supply is controlled by them and henceforth price can never tank.\n\nBanks make money by offering loans to acquire those hard-assets and since it's a \"loan\" it means leveraging up. And of course a safe-asset label would imply lower yields (maybe 3-4% net yield, with positive yearly upwards rental revisions) but since it's funded by bank a loan that amplifies the returns. Banks make the $$ from Net Interest Margins.\n\nCreating a continuous cycle of \"re-investment\" into a already crowded space.\n\nMonthly rental at that high of a current price point will naturally put a squeeze on the cost-of-living.\n\nGovt decided to \"prop-up\" the stock in a attempt to divert money away from physical assets investing. But i mean those stocks aren't really tradable (newly IPO'ed ones).\n\nUsing MSCI evaluation criteria alot of those SGX companies have very little free-floats and are tightly held by family organizations/members.

Over the last two years, I had already been traveling frequently—about 40 days per year—under my previous company’s work-from-anywhere (WFA) policy, which allowed me to test different locations across Southeast Asia. So far, I’ve spent time in various parts of Thailand, Vietnam, and most recently Cambodia.\n\nAfter being retrenched last year, I started working on my own startup, which currently earns around SGD 3,000 per month. In many Southeast Asian countries, that income allows for a relatively comfortable lifestyle.\n\nI am currently based in Cambodia and have been living here for about two months. Although Cambodia sometimes has a negative reputation due to scams or safety concerns, I’ve personally found the quality of life here to be quite decent—especially compared to Singapore. The visa process is also significantly easier than in countries like Thailand or Vietnam.\n\nIn Phnom Penh, a one-bedroom apartment with a pool and gym typically costs around SGD 700 per month, excluding utilities. Food expenses average about SGD 20–30 per day if I dine at cafés or restaurants, and can drop to around SGD 10 per day if I eat local meals.\n\nOverall, my monthly expenses are usually around SGD 2,000 if I live normally, and could be optimized further by shopping more locally. Recently, my spending went above SGD 3,000 because I’ve been exploring—visiting places like Siem Reap and Kampot, and occasionally enjoying nightlife. I’ve intentionally given myself about a year of financial runway to experiment with this lifestyle.\n\nLike you, I don’t prioritize material comfort as much as experiences. I enjoy exploring new places, nature, cafés, beaches, and different cultures. I’m also currently learning how to ride a motorbike so I can explore more independently.\n\nMy favorite places so far have been Koh Samui in Thailand and Da Nang in Vietnam. Next, I’m planning to explore Cebu City for its beaches and nightlife.\n\nUltimately, the decision is very personal. There are many countries where you can live affordably due to currency differences. I highly recommend doing a trial stay before committing long-term—living somewhere as a tourist is very different from actually living there day-to-day.\n\nHope this helps, and I’m happy to chat with anyone who’s interested in exploring this path.\n\n",

My father has been diagnosed with end-stage cancer and chemotherapy has been stopped due to repeated severe infections and he has max. 1 year to live. No other alternative treatment options have been provided.\n\nThe issue is that the 2 of them have had a construction business, with approx. 300-500k of loans outstanding. Due to my father's illness, they have been severely handicapped by their monthly earnings, and are unable to pay back the loans. He also has credit card debt, incurred to pay medical bills and does not have life insurance.\n\nWe stay in a 5-room HDB, with about 10 years left on the mortgage, and 2 out of 3 bedrooms have been rented out for some income. We also have a domestic helper, but her salary is being covered by some sort of government scheme related to disability? (forgot the name, but will update). Of the rental income, $900 is sent to me monthly to cover my rent expenses while I study; I'm working part-time to cover everything else. I spend about SGD$300 total per month, so I'm not sure if I can reduce my expenses any further. My education loan is around $300 currently, and will increase to $900 when I grad in 2027 (I am currently saving all of my additional income, in case I need to make a lump sum payment once I graduate) \n\nMy mother is of the belief that she should declare bankruptcy to reduce the financial strain on them, as my father approaches his last days. The HDB flat has both DPS and HPS, so there will be a payout upon his demise, but I'd like to know if ther's any other ways beyond bankruptcy on her end (she plans to apply for it in the next 2-6 months). I am also aware that LPAs need to be non-bankrupt, so will it cause any issues if I take that role instead, considering I'm based overseas until 2027? If anyone has another other ideas/advice, I could really use it!\n\nThank you for reading this sob story of mine and I appreciate any guidance any of you may have.",
