Grab eWallet does not work with all PayNow QR Codes. Wise app also works with some (not many) PayNow QR Codes. So keep cash as a backup. I have no idea why such a small country has so many different and incompatible QR Codes for payment The MRT and Buses will accept foreign Visa/Master cards (Apple and Google Pay), but charge S$0.60 a day for administration fee. Alternative is to buy a SimplyGo MRT card and top this up at machines in the stations. The SimplyGo App requires a Singapore number and does not always accept top up by foreign cards. If visiting Malaysia things are much more advanced for foreigners. Just install the TnG Wallet app and register and top up with a foreign card or Wise transfer.

      "selftext": "I studied in the UK/US at a great uni and am currently serving my 6 year bond. My work thus far in the public service for an economic related Ministry/Statboard has been so bad and I honestly preferred my time serving NS in my chiong sua combat unit…. If I had known what it’d be like I would’ve passed on the scholarship and gone to local U happily\n\nMicromanaging bosses, meaningless paper pushing work, bizarre SOPs and internal office initiatives are bad enough. Realizing that I’m not developing any skills and that I will be so irrelevant to any decent company outside govt/SG after my bond is another thing entirely. I believe in helping the public and volunteer extensively outside in my local CC, so I came into the job a year ago with lots of enthusiasm but now I feel completely dead inside. I sense that my leaders + bosses + colleagues are mostly very uninspirational and do not care about excellence or actually creating impactful outcomes at work - they’re happy to show up and skate by on the bare minimum. Comparing this to NS in the army (which is also a govt organisation): at least I genuinely respected some of my NS regulars who were really damn good at certain aspects of their intense job. I can’t say the same about ANYONE where I work.\n\nWhile abroad, I interned at pretty good MNCs and had return offers, but of course I couldn’t take them due to the bond. Saw all my friends go on to earn big bucks but more importantly, open up way more doors for their future career trajectory by starting their career in coveted roles. Despite being initially promised exciting exposure to policy and shaping national strategies when I signed the scholarship, I’m now working in ultra-generalist menial roles that I genuinely think a secondary school kid could do. Feel like I was sold lies coming out of JC as I haven’t used my brain since joining or learnt a single useful thing that’d give me any leverage in the job market if I wanted to leave. The other scholars around and above me are all either resigned to their fate, or also horrendously unhappy. Why did the govt pay $500k for each of us to come back and rot?\n\nI feel like I’ve been pushed and pushed myself my whole life to excel ambitiously. But in govt, there’s hardly a no point (or benchmark) for achieving excellence because my work is so slow and detached from driving real outcomes, and the bonus structure doesn’t give me any real incentive to do so. This would be a great job if all I wanted to do was lepak and collect the steady paycheck but I feel like I am just wasting my life.\n\nI have actually made some money trading stocks and I am in a position to break my bond soon, am recruiting very heavily to get out of it which provides some solace. But man does it make me sad to realise how much time I wasted, and how the system here is wasting their human capital investments.\n\nAlmost every overseas scholar I’ve met across agencies and through friends hates their life and shares similar sentiments. Especially those that made the most of their experience abroad and didn’t just stay to the SG bubble.\n\nThe people at the top need to seriously re-examine how they develop talent or even hand out these scholarships - the current system is a product of a bygone era and sticking to it just will create a massive adverse selection problem for our country’s future. When your ‘brightest’ and most dynamic people come back to sub par opportunities, they’re gonna leave or break their bond ASAP. The yes men are predominantly the ones that stay in govt and rise up to become our future leaders and politicians. It’s very insular, and maybe this is why most new policies that come out of the government these days (especially related to job creation and upskilling) feels backward looking, behind the curve, and attempting to address problems from a highly detached position.\n\nAll I can say is, my exit interview will be glorious. Feel free to ask me anything, not like I’m doing anything important at work",

Because you are a scholar, you likely expect to hit the ground running and given opportunities to show your capabilities. Good or bad, this isn't how public sector works. It is slow, methodical, by the books, and unlikely to challenge you the way you expect or desire to be challenged. This was always going to be the gamble when taking up the offer, but this is no different from the private industry. If you get bonded, you have no idea if you're going to be in a place that's going to make good use of you and where you may learn something, or whether you get wasted and learn too little.

When the choice is scaled to a large number of the population and the time changes, the reality is changed in fundamental ways. People have fewer children now, 30 years later, there is a shortfall in aged care nurses to care for old people, which often mean you need to recruit foreign nurses, and all the associated arguments around it. Choices have consequences. My answer is simply: whatever choice I make, I don't regret it. Ever. No matter the outcome. Own your choice. If you choose to have to have or not to have children, don't regret it either way. There's really no point in optimising and \"studying/researching\" the optimal way forward.

I’m thankful that I’ve not faced unemployment — I always had another offer lined up before tendering, typically taking a short 1–2 month break between roles, clearing my ALs for self love.\n\nOver the past few months though, I’ve been feeling increasingly drained and unmotivated, with a fair bit of anxiety whenever the next day is a working day. It feels like there’s no clear “end point” to corporate life, unlike schooling where timelines were always defined.\n\nLately, I’ve been seriously considering stepping away from the corporate world after a few more years, perhaps take on a few months OR a year or two of break. Thereafter, possibly to pursue something more flexible (“own time, own target” - unfortunately I don’t have a concrete plan yet).\n\nThe main reason for staying on a few more years in the corporate world would be to build a larger buffer and investment portfolio, ideally one that can cover a good portion (or all) of my monthly expenses via passive income. That way, I feel that I will be less anxious about leaving my job at that point of time.\n\nWould appreciate perspectives from those who’ve done something similar:\n\nBefore leaving, did you aim for a specific portfolio size or expense multiple for peace of mind?\n\nHow old were you when you made the move?\n\nDid you eventually return to a full-time corporate role, or transition into something else?\n\nSeeking advice and shared experiences only — not looking to be flamed. 🙏 Thanks in advance.",

As the other commenter said, do make sure you have your ducks in a row for your financial commitments for the few months that you want to take a break. Set a timeline for yourself, take a break, find out what motivates you beyond the corporate life. After all, we work hard so that we can give ourselves some buffer when we can afford them. The catch though is that we ARE unfortunately in a period where it's difficult to find a job.

I'll be searching for a new job from mid-2026 when I return to SG. My advice is, go for it since you've been working for a decade as well. But make sure you have enough finances to tide through for a year. If one year sounds scary, try six months and maybe can extend later. Are you staying in your own home? Rent it out. If you're staying with your folks, perhaps can also consider renting out your room for a year for passive income. I didn't have any passive income so I had to make sure my finances were in place. I intend to do career break every 10 years or so to recharge myself. So the next planned career break might be somewhere in 2035.

Already have ISP and early CI for medical coverage. Also own term life coverage till age 60 (for parents mainly).\n\n- 1 savings insurance plan to be fully paid in 8 years time, not letting go as already far in and intend it as a low risk option in the meantime and maybe use it to top up VWRA or CPF to FRS/ERS after maturity.\n\n- No other investments currently as I was focused on being debt free.\n\n- Salary in the 7% income tax bracket.\n\nCurrent Plan:\n\n- Top up CPF SA to FRS to get tax relief and the low risk interest.\n\n- Invest all spare cash from employment into VWRA via IBKR for at least 10 years (est 12 - 20k annually, dependent on bonuses). I opened an account and am ready to DCA.\n\n- Reinvest CPF OA monies above 20k balance into an ETF (most likely Amundi World?)\n\nFuture plan:\n\n- stop working at age 50 for maybe 1-2 years and survive via whole unit rental and geo-arbitrage through slow travel in LCOL countries. Like this, visa is not really a concern as intend to just stay a few months. I will likely to have to split a portion of the rental income with a sibling as I intend to use their home extra room as a base, we may also decide to formally move in together and share the rental income. In worst case scenario, may have to draw from savings or investments.\n\n*Caveat: This plan may be delayed a few years dependent on parent health situation as well.\n\n- find a lower paid and stress free role to cover daily expenses to coast till retirement age\n\n- Intend to not touch my ETFs and let it compound till retirement age.\n\nSome thoughts:\n\n- I do not foresee myself able to retire early as I am lower income. However, don't think I can continue the slog till retirement age. Maybe this is me still stuck a bit in the YOLO mindset but I prefer to take a break in between and not delaying plans to travel at a much older age.\n\n- simple lifestyle works for me, not exactly cai png only as I enjoy food. But not the kind must dine at restaurants regularly and am ok to cook own meals. Hobbies are generally cheap (reading, taking outdoor walks and playing games).\n\n- will need to work after the break as still need to pay for medical insurances, also think I am the type that prefers some structure and routine regular employment  provides. Have a family member who is PHV driver, we discussed before can share and split the vehicle rental cost as an employment option.\n\n- also am padding more for retirement age (targeting ERS) as single must take care of ownself, have extended family (nieces and nephews) as support but do not want to trouble them financially, just probably need help with admin stuff if one day I have to move to a home.\n\n- Plan to die with zero, if I go early or have leftovers from CPF and investments to benefit my nieces and nephews will be nice but no a must.\n\nWelcome any inputs to help take a more cautious approach or update me of any major gaps I missed. Thanks a lot in advance!",
