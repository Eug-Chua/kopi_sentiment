There's steady progress that's been made there, regardless how different people might perceive its intents and purposes.\n\nHere's a 10-point plan outlining how our buses can be further improved, upon the basis of existing initiatives intended to enhance service, accessibility and connectivity for residents across Singapore.\n\nLet me know what you guys think about these proposed plans, and feel free to reach out to discuss them in greater depth! :)\n\nClarifications section, because I couldn't fit every last elaborate detail into the slides:\n\n\\#2 Redesigns to major \"hub\" bus stops and bus interchanges are intended to also improve the efficiency of passenger and bus flow, thus reducing the time spent bottlenecking around them, which is a common problem in current bus infrastructure designs.\n\n\\#4 a) Please note the distinction between rapid and express stopping patterns, b) \"Direct express\" routes referenced indicate bus services that operate in a pure point-to-point fashion, operating between two termini with \\*zero\\* intermediate stops, covering long distances across Singapore, c) \"Relay express\" routes are of a similar nature, but instead cover shorter links bridging gaps in the MRT network\n\n\\#5 Lower base fares help offset the removal of feeder fare caps for (est. two-thirds or more) bus riders, whose feeder bus rides lie outside the 3.2km feeder cap range.\n\n\\#9 Despite feeder integration, existing local bus connections will be retained to the maximum extent possible.\n\n\\#10 The expanded premium scheme differs from current premium bus services in the sense that private bus operators are given more flexibility to design their own routes and schedules to meet unmet demand, as opposed to the current arrangement where routes and schedules are set by LTA and subcontracted to private companies.",

An operator that is consistently shit will stand out. Without competitors, the entity can become complacent.\n\nJust like how SBS Transit makes SMRT Trains look bad, we cannot have a monopoly where the entire system is operated by just one entity.\n\nFor #2, it is probably not possible to implement on some of the worst examples of bus interchanges. \n\nIf anyone need an example of a shitty bus interchange, just look at Yishun. Many key feeders are at the far end of the interchange. Maybe that is why 807 at opposite Khatib MRT bus stop is so chaotic and crowded. Nobody wants to walk 400m, going up and down multiple escalators, just to get to the berth in the freaking interchange, when the bus stop at Khatib is only 100m away.\n\nI think #9 is not that helpful. Combined portions for feeders tend to be well served corridors, or stops that are relatively closer to the MRT/interchange. They do not really need that frequency boost, compared to the more distant stops which feeder routes are really serving.\n\nFeeders are supposed to get people from the distant parts of a town to the town centre. People who are already near the town centre is not the key targets for feeders.\n\nHonestly, SG needs full day “express” buses (not just express bus, but also buses with long express sectors) that parallels MRT lines. The 500 series that links the east and west to town is good, but that is sorely lacking from the northern and northeastern side.\n\nRight now, many express bus routes from the north simply are not competitive. You are paying more in terms of fares and time, just to get away from crowds.\n\nTime should not be part of the trade-off! The ideal express route should be a trade-off between paying more for comfort (with equivalent travel time).\n\nAsk yourself, who the heck would take 851e, from say Clarke Quay to Yishun, when you have to pay express fare, wait for a bus that comes at the frequency of 30 mins, and still take longer than the MRT (plus transfers) to get to Yishun! Unless you really do not want to stand or you do not want crowds, why would you even take that bus? No wonder ridership is crap.\n\nFull day city direct services would be good. City direct services are actually competitive in terms of time, compared to MRT. It is really an ideal trade off between paying more and comfort.\n\nWhich is why for the routes that are competitive, they can be quite packed.",

It is okay to reject being a bridesmaid if you think you dont not have the bandwidth. \n\nAnd depending on how close you are to the bride, like my good friend despite in the midst of divorce she still find the mental strength and bandwidth to be a bridesmaid. This is because she is very good friend with the bride, and the bride is not chinese, who is not pantang whether a \"divorcee\" will pass the luck to the newlyweds.

He said he felt fine and could walk, and when I brought up seeing a doctor or going to hospital he strongly refused. So I just walked him to his destination (a government building) and sat him down safely so he could wait for it to open (we lost contact after that... I was in a rush to get to work). In retrospect I’m really worried I should have called emergency services despite his refusal given his age, I know it was extremely stupid not to, but I really wasn’t thinking clearly at the time :(\n\nIs there anything appropriate to do after the fact? Is there any point in calling emergency to report the fall now even if I have no way of identifying him? (I know it doesn't really make sense since presumably there's no way to reliably trace him, but idk would it be helpful for their records if he were to maybe turn up at the hospital needing medical care later?) If I call up the government building to ask if they'd seen him just now, I assume they wouldn't be able to disclose his contact since it might be a PDPA violation or something?

She was a 15-year-old student at the time of the offences.",

You gotta zoom in to daily cash flows instead of looking at your month end balance. \n\n  \n\nI’ve started treating finances like a game where I play daily.\n\n  \n\nYou’re gonna want to buy that artisanal coffee for $7. But once you defeat that temptation, that “in-game monster” is gonna drop $7 for you to collect.\n\n  \n\nOnly managing your finances at the end of the month when bills are due is gonna be hard if you don’t have stop gaps every 30 days of the month.\n\n  \n\nSo go forth and defeat your daily temptations: reserve 1 day a week to treat yourself to a casual meal. Negotiate downwards how many drinks you’re gonna have at a social event. \n\n  \n\nFinances is as much internal as it is tangible.\n\n  \n\nFrom somebody who lives paycheck to paycheck, I managed this month with money leftover on payday so I see this game as a success even though I’m only level 3.\n\n  \n\nAnother pro tip: those with high credit card balances - and find yourself with little to no cash after payday. Convert your balance to installments and stop using CC. Use cash and you can eat $5 cai png instead of having to charge food to your credit to survive. It’s cheaper in the long run and prevents snowball. ",
