I think its notable the vox pops here are all basically positive. Its completely fair to be concerned about developing tourism sustainably, and lucratively. I wouldn't want to live on Koon Seng Road (a problem which solves itself: I can't afford those houses).\n\nRealistically, I only caught the end of Joo Chiat before it started to gentrify. I don't think you should romanticise it too much - the density of vice bars was pretty high. Those have been pushed out, and now you have your Picotin and your Little Farms and (praise be) Two Man Bagel but the bak kut teh, laksa and Ali bar bar places are literally unchanged for a decade. \n\nIt's interesting how there's quite a lot of comments about increasing the heritage education side of the area. I'm a history geek and I am all for this, but it is a bit harsh. You cannot walk further than a few minutes without finding a plaque describing the history of a particular street or building. There's a few long standing museums and the old Peranakan community centre and museum. We have got to be realistic that this isn't going to be everybody's cup of tea though and whatever gets spending punters into the neighbourhood is a good thing.\n\nI would struggle as a resident to think of many negative changes to the area. It is not a bad thing to have traded girly bars for Picotin. My rent went up during covid, same as everybody else, and now local rents are going down again. I am spoiled for choice for cafes, restaurants and bars, and gentrification has its limits and I've seen overpriced and trendy businesses not make it, while some rough and ready places are permanent. If I want to go to the park its five minutes away and its no busier than it ever was. Services have improved, most notably with the new MRT line and you would never struggle for a doctor's appointment. I've seen several huge new condos been built, with more all the time. Surely that must make a difference but I don't notice it.\n\nThe biggest negative I can think of has been the changes made to the F&amp;B establishments in East Coast Park. There's been some strange choices there - demolishing the building that housed George's Bar but building nothing else there, renovating the units by the beach and pushing out some cheap and cheerful Thai place to be replaced with another part of the PS Cafe Group.\n\nAll in all its a success story.

Your parents are people too, with interests, fears and aspirations etc. Treasure them before they are gone, often all too soon.\n\n\n\n",

Privacy / distance from noise and smell generating facilities such as waste collection centres, schools and playgrounds.\n4. Sun facing.\n5.

Eg: Double glazed windows, soundproof doors, solar and privacy window films, air-conditioning etc so we placed them lower on the priority list. \n\nWe could not accept any deviation for point 1 because we absolutely wanted to reduce the chances of having to deal with crazy people. We have no choice but to share our ceilings and floors with those living above and below us but at the very least we wanted to remove the chances of meeting crazy people on our sides. Point 2 was also very important because it would help to save a lot of time over the years.\n\nIn your case, between your 2 choices, I would pick option 1. Corridor unit on a higher floor with little sun sounds much easier to deal with than a corner unit with direct sun on a lower floor. For option 1 you can just get a soundproof door and keep it closed or get a privacy gate if you want to keep the door open. For option 2, you would need to get soundproof windows, solar films and constantly keep the aircon on which would definitely cost much more than the door/gate.

I only do home workouts, too lazy to go gym lol. Also have to eat right. For me what works is small meals through the day &amp; I avoid eating after 7. Quite tough for night shifts but I still perservere. If really can’t tahan then I have a 1/2 glass of milk. Also avoid snacking, high sugar foods, excessive alcohol. I don’t smoke either. Drinks lots of water as well. Some of my collegues take melatonin to help them sleep cos our bodyclocks are all crazy. \n\nMy advice is not to stay on shift for too long like myself. Shift work has it’s perks but not good on the body long term. You’ll also miss out on public holidays, weekend activites with family &amp; friends.

Might sound reckless given how the job market right now might not be so good, but I think a break might be a good time to rest, pick up new skills (familiarising myself with LLMs maybe), and do something that fulfils me more (perhaps study math...?).\n\nOne concern I have is that I might struggle to find a suitable role once I return from an extended break - like it'll look like I've been unemployed for months. But I feel like staying doesn't seem like the right choice either, nor am I sure if I really want to continue down the career path I'm on.\n\nI expect to save up maybe around S$35-40k when I leave. Expenses about S$2k/month if I don't go on trips etc. I might want to go on a trip though. And thereafter, I might be interested in the startup space in general (great if there are communities I can look into).\n\nConsidering applying for roles in my industry in meantime to see what kind of salary I can get if I continue in similar roles, so I might be able to establish some sort of baseline opportunity cost.\n\nHoping that some might be able to help talk me through ideas please\n\nEDIT: Ideas gathered thus far:\n\n1. Apply for jobs in meantime - see what kind of pay I can get\n2. Take 3-weeks leave first to chill, think, and plan\n3. Then, take one-month notice after coming back if planned\n4. After resigning - maybe a trip!\n5. May take CFA. Or prep for potentially higher paying role\n6. May take tech courses too, e.g. to use LLMs to get better at current or other work\n7. Attend events, talk to people, message people on LinkedIn, cold email others\n8. If returning to another job next time, prepare narrative\n9. ???\n\nHoping to get more ideas and talk thru more, DMs welcome!",

Most people in SG ~are~ (or say they are) in monogamous relationships, and I'd imagine most of your bf's friends are too. So it'd be interesting to see if they'd be OK with their own gf or wife stepping outside their marriage and rubbing up other men even if there is no penetration and since it's \"all just physical, there's no emotions or feelings involved\" lor. (The answer is, most probably not, because double standards.)\n\nUltimately, it's between just you and your bf to decide, define and maintain the boundaries of your two's own relationship. Whether it's OK for one person to go to such lup sup places and if go, maximum can only drink and lap dance etc; or cannot go entirely.

Any costs? Is there a better way?\n\n2) Can I move the money from DBS SRS to another SRS that's easier to invest in while keeping the DBS one open so that I can receive new money every month?

What you can invest in depends on your brokerage account.\n\n  \nSo what you need now is to find a brokerage that can support SRS investing. The most common ones are POEMS and Stashaway. For Singapore, you generally can't find a good way to invest SRS funds into single stocks like GOOG but LSE ETFs are more easily accessible. Typical investments for SRS funds include the Amundi World Unit Trust (similar to SWRD) via POEMs and Amundi US Trust (similar to CSPX I believe) via POEMs. Note that these are Unit Trusts, not ETFs.\n\n\n\nStashway recently introduced a new product called ETF Explorer where you can buy ETFs directly via their platform at a 1 USD fee. You have access to ISAC, which is again similar to SWRD via this route.",

SRS seems powerful because withdrawals are spread over just 10 years. If structured properly, it can cover a meaningful portion of living expenses during that window.\n\nWould you plan to fully draw down SRS to zero over those 10 years? Or pace it more conservatively?\n\n1. The timing between SRS and CPF LIFE feels slightly misaligned. SRS penalty-free withdrawals start at 63, but CPF LIFE payouts begin at 65 (earliest). That creates a 2-year gap.\n\nWas this intentional policy design? Or just historical layering of schemes?\n\n1. Because of that timing difference, some retirement years feel more “secure” than others with SRS or CPF LIFE payouts reducing the need for investment drawdowns.\n\nPost-65 looks relatively stable under current policies. The real challenge seems to be retiring earlier (say 55) and bridging the 55–65 gap.\n\nWhich brings me to CPF OA.\n\nHow do you think about managing OA in retirement planning?  \n• Regular withdrawal?  \n• Lump sum withdrawal and invest externally?  \n• Leave it untouched as a conservative buffer?\n\nCurious how others are structuring this?\n\nSeparately, I built a small tool to model CPF LIFE and SRS projections while exploring these questions.

I’m currently in quite a bad situation, I owe money to 3 different ah long. It started with one small loan because I was short of cash and thought I could pay back fast, but interest snowball like crazy. Then I panic and stupidly borrow from another one to cover the first, and now it become 3. I know it’s my own fault, I damn regret already. They keep calling, texting, threaten to come find me , I haven’t never told my parents because my relationship with them was never stable and i always act on my own, but the stress is killing me. I cant sleep properly and everyday Im scared they splash paint or harass people around me. I’m trying to work and save but the interest keep increasing until I feel like no way out. Has anyone been through this before?  I really want to settle properly and stop this cycle. Any real advice appreciated, thanks. 🙏🙏",
