Here’s an example. if you have 100 g your fee is (0.25% x 100)/12 = 0.02 which is less than the minimum of 0.12g. So they will charge you 0.12 g. By the end of your first month you are left with 100g - 0.12g =99.88 g. Over a year you will pay 1.44 g + GST in fees. You’re losing more than 1.5% a year. If however you have 576 g your fee is (0.25% x 100)/12 = 0.12 g (which is the minimum that will be charged). Then you are also losing 1.44g + GST in fees but only 0.25% as a percentage of your holdings in fees in a year. This means that anything less than 576g is sub optimal. You need to hold at least 576 g of gold in the account which is about 109K ($190/g) in today’s price. If you just want exposure to gold price then an ETF is fine. Theres less friction. But you can’t ask for the “pet rock”. The UOB gold savings account is a very old product. It pre-existed before the ETFs and mobile trading platforms were available. It was one of the few ways to get exposure to gold without holding gold. So that’s the historical context. Today OCBC has a similar product. The OCBC product has a wider spread but no fees and no way to convert to physical. One feature of the UOB gold savings account is that it allows you to convert your holdings into physical by paying a premium and then collecting it at the main branch. If you don’t care for the “pet rock” and if you don’t have 109k to dump into gold, it’s not an appropriate product. Recently I think UOB has also limited the purchase of its gold to customers of the bank. If you have no banking relationship with UOB , you can’t buy physical gold from UOB. But that’s not a big deal these days.",

Here’s an example. if you have 100 g your fee is (0.25% x 100)/12 = 0.02 which is less than the minimum of 0.12g. So they will charge you 0.12 g. By the end of your first month you are left with 100g - 0.12g =99.88 g. Over a year you will pay 1.44 g + GST in fees. You’re losing more than 1.5% a year. If however you have 576 g your fee is (0.25% x 100)/12 = 0.12 g (which is the minimum that will be charged). Then you are also losing 1.44g + GST in fees but only 0.25% as a percentage of your holdings in fees in a year. This means that anything less than 576g is sub optimal. You need to hold at least 576 g of gold in the account which is about 109K ($190/g) in today’s price. If you just want exposure to gold price then an ETF is fine. Theres less friction. But you can’t ask for the “pet rock”. The UOB gold savings account is a very old product. It pre-existed before the ETFs and mobile trading platforms were available. It was one of the few ways to get exposure to gold without holding gold. So that’s the historical context. Today OCBC has a similar product. The OCBC product has a wider spread but no fees and no way to convert to physical. One feature of the UOB gold savings account is that it allows you to convert your holdings into physical by paying a premium and then collecting it at the main branch. If you don’t care for the “pet rock” and if you don’t have 109k to dump into gold, it’s not an appropriate product. Recently I think UOB has also limited the purchase of its gold to customers of the bank. If you have no banking relationship with UOB , you can’t buy physical gold from UOB. But that’s not a big deal these days.",
