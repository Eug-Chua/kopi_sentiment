The fatal Chinatown accident involving a 6-year-old girl has sparked deep fears about road safety and dangerous driving, with many expressing alarm at the driver's perceived lack of remorse. Scam-related fears also surfaced strongly, as Singaporeans shared experiences with sophisticated overseas scam operations using fake police backgrounds. Financial insecurity weighs heavily on minds, with workers worried about job market volatility and whether retirement savings will suffice in an increasingly expensive city.",

Then a PRC woman stood just outside but between me and the person in front. She took out her phone and took a pic of the menu which was between me and the first in queue. I had a feeling (likely stereotyped her) she was going to cut queue so i inched in closer to the person in front. She saw that and without facing me, she slid in between me and the person in front. I kept quiet and waited to see if she would really make her order when it was her turn. And just as she thought i let that slid, she opened her mouth to make her order to the cashier oblivious to the whole move, i raised my voice right at her face. \"Eh, there is a queue here, dont cut queue\" in Mandarin. She turned to me and replied she didnt see and there is no need to raise my voice. I replied louder in front of all the people in the place, \"U didnt see me, WTF!\" In English. She went quietly to the end of the queue. After I got my order, i deliberately walked to her. Before I can opened my mouth she shouted at me saying, \"U are of a low quality character to scold me like that\". I replied in Mandarin, \"I have to do so with people of low quality like u\". And i walked away. For that 20 secs or so while i walked away, she shouted at me scolding me. Her voice literally pierced through the whole ground floor of the building. I sashayed my ass slowly and quietly soaking in all the attention while making my exit.",

The fact that he paused for 13 minutes and decided not to consult other doctors and try to rectify the error when the victim was already on the table shows he is more willing to cover his ass than do what is best for the patient. A lot of excuses after the surgery. If he believed his actions were the best, which is to close the victim up and observe, I'm sure the surgical notes would have been transparent and instructions would have been given for the victim to be closely monitored and clear next steps given, not wait for the woman to be crying in pain then take 45 minutes to provide instructions, then go through all the different tests.

        "text": "That woman murdered her and traffic laws are complicit. Why whenever a negligent driver runs someone over it's \"just an accident\" and not manslaughter. It is always treated like the driver is the victim of chance and it's not their fault or responsibility in anyway. In news articles it's always reported \"person dies in car accident\" \"kid is hit by driver\" they dehumanise the negligent driver responsible and act like these occurrences are just a fact of life. We have drivers licences for a reason, you are supposed to be responsible with machinery that can take someone's life in an instant. It's like firing a gun at random and when you shoot someone claiming it's an accident and you're not at fault. A car did not kill this little girl. That woman murdered her, she ran her over twice, that is not an accident.",

I had a feeling (likely stereotyped her) she was going to cut queue so i inched in closer to the person in front. She saw that and without facing me, she slid in between me and the person in front. I kept quiet and waited to see if she would really make her order when it was her turn. And just as she thought i let that slid, she opened her mouth to make her order to the cashier oblivious to the whole move, i raised my voice right at her face. \"Eh, there is a queue here, dont cut queue\" in Mandarin. She turned to me and replied she didnt see and there is no need to raise my voice. I replied louder in front of all the people in the place, \"U didnt see me, WTF!\" In English. She went quietly to the end of the queue. After I got my order, i deliberately walked to her. Before I can opened my mouth she shouted at me saying, \"U are of a low quality character to scold me like that\". I replied in Mandarin, \"I have to do so with people of low quality like u\". And i walked away. For that 20 secs or so while i walked away, she shouted at me scolding me. Her voice literally pierced through the whole ground floor of the building.
