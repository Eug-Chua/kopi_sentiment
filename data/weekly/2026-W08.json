While Singaporean locals (and others) might feel like the 2 years is a waste of time, it was probably the biggest character building experience for me because of the cultural shock, discipline, the tougher living conditions during training and the real world experience (I was in SCDF as a Section Commander in a fire station rota). This has translated to certain soft skills such as communication and ability to work calmly under extremely stressful situations.",
