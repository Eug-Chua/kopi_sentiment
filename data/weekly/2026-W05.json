Career uncertainty haunts engineers and tech workers in their early 30s who fear they've chosen the wrong path. Housing insecurity weighs heavily on those married to foreigners, while job seekers express deep concern about rescinded offers and interview processes that seem increasingly unpredictable.",

Infrastructure failures, inadequate enforcement of laws, and perceived government inaction on multiple fronts have created a perfect storm of public discontent. The sentiment is overwhelmingly one of systemic frustration with institutions failing to address basic quality-of-life issues.",

So without the app telling me the next bus timing, I waited... and waited... and waited.. and 20 mins later, 3 bus 74s came at once. 😑 And I ended up being late for work. If I had known there was this delay, I would definitely have taken a different bus to Clementi from the start. Really hope the app will be working again tomorrow. 🙏🏻",
