"he's spouting fucking horseshit. breaking the GST increment into two gives the coffeshop owner (in his example) the chance to raise the price by 10 cents in one year then again by 10 cents in the next year under the excuse of covering GST, exactly what Pritam talked about by turbocharging inflation. were it not for that, even if there were the other factors, prices might have just been raised once instead of twice. and let's not fucking beat around the bush here. no matter how you slice it, a 2 ppt increase in GST is still an additional 2 ppt of inflation that was painful at a time of spiraling costs. so maybe external factors caused inflation of 5% or whatever, but why did the government have to add an additional 1 ppt for two years to that? that's an additional 20% pain. also, what fucking bullshit is he on about comparing CDC vouchers to the rise in GST? CDC vouchers are to cope with the cost of living in general! for core inflation of 2.7% last year (which excludes housing and COE prices, so I'm being generous here), that's less than 30k of spending per household. I fucking guarantee that the average household spends more than 30k per year, making them worse off.

"Read the comments in this topic and another recent similar topic about 'SG being a retail colony', and the common refrain observed is ""why pick on PRC retail food stores when there were previous/parallel waves of American/korean/jap food stalls""? The key difference is that the proliferation of such food stalls is part of a self-reinforcing loop that feeds a burgeoning PRC expat bubble. In other cultural food waves, the expat presence is not comparable to the current PRC bubble - one does not see the ""American/Koreans/Japs"" community everywhere. Second key difference is the minimal use of English language in their storefronts. menus, signages, apps and communications medium with the customer. Granted the early Jap and Korean restaurants could be guilty of this as well but the PRC version almost makes local feel that the target consumer audience is almost exclusively... the PRC expat/community bubble. Locals patronising such stores are bonus revenue. Thirdly, another common refrain is to ""let market forces decide, and sooner or later the overproliferation will curb itself"" - let consumers vote with their dollar. Sure,but what if you - the local - were never their target audience to begin with ? How then would market forces decide - if such forces are already being distorted in the first placeby 1) the disproportionally huge presence of the PRC expat bubble here, and 2) the PRC-headquartered businesses needing to expand into overseas market because of 'money-laundering' concerns or because of the stagnating domestic economy? Market forces does not work or are slow to work, because locals cannot move the needle, even if they vote with their wallets. These are IMHO, what makes the current PRC food wave/tsunami so distinctively different from other cultural food waves. Not happy with the PRC restaurant? Please go take a queue number, because there are 99 ah tiongs behind you waiting in line to eat. Your absence does not make a difference to their bottomline because the PRC expat bubble is self-sustaining. That's what makes the PRC food wave so alarming.",,,fear,moderate,206,"The problem with Mainland Chinese restaurants in Singapore is the language barrier and lack of English, as a Non-Chinese Singaporean",prices
