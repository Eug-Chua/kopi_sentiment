"Looked at some data, so going to adjust my views abit. Lets use the SRX Index for HDB 4 rooms rather than top prices, because those can be skewed by stuff like pricing for executive apartments being different than the stuff people usually buy. The Index for July 2012 at 143.5, for July 2025 at 213.1. So an increase of 48.5%. So, the argument that Lawrence Wong is making that increasing HDB prices are driven by increasing incomes does hold some water. This is why I talked about the ""market clearing jobs"". If someone is able to earn median income and keep earning median income throughout their lives then things may be ok.  However if they are unable to keep up due to employment issues, then it gets quite painful (especially if they need to delay their HDB purchase due to single or late marriage - which causes savings wipe out due to HDB appreciation). However this moves the politics of land price onto the politics of employment. Forcing Singaporeans to intensify, upskill and seek more lucrative employment - with Singapore already being an expensive late stage post-industrial economy - each increase in salary isn't exactly easy to fight for. For those who have not yet bought housing yet and fixed in a mortgage, there is a sense then of ""running to stay in place"" or a ""fear of being left behind"". For those who have bought housing already and fixed in a mortgage, then things can be quite chill.

"Ok, so just some background on this particular bus lane. Before it was converted into dotted yellow lines, it was already a pointless bus lane, cos it was a dotted line for a few metres after the filter lane, followed by a very short stretch of straight yellow line, and then it becomes dotted the whole way again. The issue was, cars found it very difficult to filter from Bidadari Park Drive to Upper Serangoon Road during peak hours as they had to filter two lanes at one go. This resulted in quite a lengthy backlog along Bidadari Park Drive in the morning AND buses plying along Bidadari Park Drive ended up being delayed too. For those cars who dared to venture out, some got stuck in the bus lane trying to filter into the non-bus lane. They essentially blocked the whole bus lane although the whole lane ahead was completely clear. And you have to remember they had to filter out just cos of that small stretch of solid yellow line which ends up becoming dotted again. So buses got stuck behind such cars because of the solid yellow line. Of course some cars got pressured and just drove ahead in the bus lane anyway but LTA likes to station enforcement officers there as well lol. Anyway, if they are going to the expressway they are forced to turn back to the dotted yellow line anyway... And those who are going towards bendemeer have to eventually filter out anyway. Just that now they have more opportunity to gain speed and filter out rather than get stuck there and depend on the goodwill of drivers. Just giving some context as to this change.
