"I’d like to offer a perspective from the woman’s side. We know how things ended, but we don’t know her story. When I was 20, my ex also took his own life after I proposed to end our relationship. He couldn’t accept the breakup. He often hurt himself to seek forgiveness whenever he did something wrong. When I asked for space to cool down, he would insist on resolving things immediately. His self-harm would escalate; from hitting his head, to banging it against furniture, to threatening suicide. There were times I had to pull him back from a ledge or run through his condo trying to find him. It became unbearable, and I finally decided to end things for good. He couldn’t accept it, and he ended his life in his room. For years, I blamed myself for what had happened. For the first 3 years after his death, I refused to allow myself to feel happiness. I spent time with his mother often, going for art jamming and having coffee because it was my way of staying close to him. It took me more than five years before I could open my heart to someone new. It’s easy to pass judgment, but we’re not them. My friends used to tell me it wasn’t my fault - that if someone truly intends to end their life, they will. Reading the recent news, seeing that this man had attempted it twice, reminded me again: if a person has made up their mind, no one else can change it. Unless the girl surrendered her entire being to his pain, living her life around his fragility. But no one should be expected to bear that kind of weight; it’s not fair to call that love or loyalty.",1081,"S'pore man, 29, allegedly commits suicide after ex-girlfriend ends relationship & asks to cancel BTO",t3_1oql4gw,BTO
Went through the same thing 2 years back. Cancel BTO breakup after 5+ years and just graduated. Didnt think to kill myself but it was definitely tough walking out of it,830,"S'pore man, 29, allegedly commits suicide after ex-girlfriend ends relationship & asks to cancel BTO",t3_1oql4gw,BTO
"Same here and I absolutely agree. It took a lot of time, support from friends and family,  therapy and learning that it's ok and even healthy to cry. The deposit forfeiting didn't compare to losing someone one deemed as their best friend and partner for life, regardless of the cause of the breakup. I hope that this thread is a reminder to anyone going through something similar, that it's a really tough situation, but you're going to overcome it and even look back on the experience as a worthwhile experience that built a lot of resilience and personal growth. Lean on all the support options you need, and don't give up. And shame on those who are using this story to project their incel behaviour. I am sure the ex partner doesn't feel any better about the situation.

"From what the mum fed to Stomp, I don’t get very good vibes from her. She looks like those toxic, traditionalist tiger mums. She just wants to marry off her son asap. By hook or by crook, he needs to get married. She’s banking on him to pass down the family line (only son). Even when cracks are showing in the relationship, the wedding must go on. But it takes two hands to clap. When one party isn’t satisfied, then this relationship is already problematic. It’s better to breakup now than to breakup much later when things become more entrenched. And this whole my son is a good boy, why must she break up with him trope just reeks of helicopter parenting. Not just that, it ignores the fact that the girlfriend has her right to agency. She can choose who she wants to date. And as a woman, the mum has zero empathy or understanding on this point. I’ve seen it too many times, the ones harshest to women are not men but other women. The poor young man was probably so coddled or straight jacketed that he ended up with low self esteem, he found failure especially difficult to deal with. His ex said that she tried but was unsuccessful in getting him improve himself. The mum must have been dominating in his life, the he switched jobs just to please her. I don’t think the girlfriend is the only major source of pressure in his life.

"Good question. Let me preface by saying that it is difficult to separatepolicyand the actualstate of affairsbecause of fundamental physical or cultural differences between the two countries (and in the case of the US, State). For instance, I don't think it's fair to fault PAP for the horrid weather, though quality of life would skyrocket if it was ""fixed"". Other issues are a bit of a gray area, for example, overcrowding. Singapore is small, so obviously it will be more crowded than your average city. But you could also make the case that unbridled immigration policy played a part in this. At any rate, I'd readily admit it is hard to make a direct apples to apples comparison on most policies, and at some point you'd have to be prepared to make a judgement call. I'd also focus on the more controversial things... to spice things up. The first overrated thing I realized was transport. I know it's crazy, but I found the NYC subway not nearly as bad as I thought. Gross as heck, but it got me to where I wanted to. And fast, thanks to express trains. For a tourist, it's absolutely terrible and confusing, but as a resident, I found it actually okay. Upon returning to SG, I found our MRTs more crowded than the NYC subway, and tbh, more unbearable simply because of the duration of the journey! The second thing was... education. Unbelievable, isn't it? Now this is one of those gray areas because I didn't go through it myself, nor do I have kids there. When I first moved to the States, I was pretty proud of SG's education system. Maybe it wasn't the most inspiring, but it certainly provided a lower bound, right? All I heard about the US education system was how decrepit it was, e.g., with public school teachers having to fork out money to buy their markers etc. And school shootings. But when I look at outcomes, Singapore seems behind ineverythingexcept ... tests. It's very strange. We have some really smart people academically, and they are certainly doing well. But Singaporeans seem to have a really low upper bound in their career. Even those who move abroad. I'm not talking about Nobel prizes or that kind of achievement. I'm just talking about the top 20% or so. The fact that we are fawning over Chew Shou Zi says something. Something about our education system is neutering our brightest students. Or god forbid there is something that US's (public or private?) schooling system is doing right. The last one is industrial policy. This is an area I think both the PAP and opposition are shying away from, because neither has a solution, and certainly not me. I think our companies are mollycoddled by the G. LocalandMNCs. Wait isn't that strange? Isn't that a description reserved for our decadent youngsters? Hear me out. It is no secret that many of our industries are very, very inefficient. A classic case is construction. The construction industry here isextremelymanpower inefficient, hence the large number of migrant, temporary workers. What does this have to do with the G? Isn't it just the free market? Normally, the G would limit immigration to force companies to improve, especially with respect to labour and immigration. But when push comes to shove, italwaysgets soft hearted and allows the status quo. Here's another example: integration of academia, government and industry. I used to be in academia in the US. There, there was a very clear pipeline of blue sky, translational to commercial product. Despite all the bluster we are used to in the US, the research front (except maybe in the past 1-2 months) was actually really well done. There's a reason why they are an innovation powerhouse; these components of their innovation engine are all churning in unison, from the way government grants are disbursed, all the way to immigration policy. Here... we have a ton of weird grants, projects, scholarships that are all over the place. Companies are expecting plug-and-play employees from universities. There isn't a lot of coherence between labour, education, and industrial requirements. Are there things that I prefer in SG? Yes. Healthcare system is a mess in the US. And perhaps surprisingly, I think that limiting protests to HLP is a good idea. Don't get me started on the drug policies in the US. (Now if you trawl through my post history you'd notice housing is my top election issue, but I didn't bring it up here. Why? Because I think it's unfair to compare the two country's housing policies given they are so physically different. But in case you were wondering, a single average resale flat can get me a entire house in one of the cities I stayed in, and easily!)",15,An open letter to Singapore from a young Singaporean.,t3_1kakrfi,BTO

Transportation - I do think there is more to improve, although I might look towards Japan, Korea, China as targets. The misstep was privatising a public good, only to have to take it back later on, and having to spend a lot more to make it good enough again.
Education - Definitely needs a shift away from memorisation.  But it's a huge change management exercise as parents & teachers alike need to acknowledge tests isn't the way to go. For the longest time, education policies were around producing graduates with the knowledge and skills to support an industry, like when Chemical & Bio-engineering was the fade so many courses in our universities.

Or god forbid there is something that US's (public or private?) schooling system is doing right. I don’t think it is quite fair to talk about the top 20% this way. Singapore’s population is small. If there is a 1 in 1 million chance someone is a genius and the education system and learning environment was identical, then we might have 5 geniuses, but USA is going to have hundreds of them, giving the impression they have a better system.

This landlord has 6 units empty, which means the prices are actually too high for the market and they're delusional. The solution is to charge some kind of underutilization fee, or have some kind of property tax. The challenge is that enforcement for the fee will be difficult, and landlords will definitely try to pass that fee down to customers.

"I mentioned some similar points in the other thread about the traineeship programme. Singapore need Singapore rooted MNCs to create quality jobs, we cannot rely on our unique selling points forever. We cannot compete on cheapness, on that front, we will lose instantly. We compete on quality. Quality English-speaking workforce. But nowadays, other countries in Asia are catching up. With just a fraction of our cost, the value proposition of our quality is limited. We also have another selling point, which is stability, good infrastructure, low taxation, and minimised bureaucracy. This is something that others in the region lack, which makes us more alluring despite our workers being not cost effective (for the same level of quality). But that selling point has a problem. It’s a “race to the bottom” selling point, which means we are often stuck with it, especially the part about taxation or policies. However, think of it this way, what does a city do, what is its role? A city taps upon the surrounding rural and less developed areas, make them dependent on its services, and prosper by providing them. In fact, that is exactly what we are doing now with the hub model. We are the hub for SEA and even APAC. But, by relying on foreign MNCs, our hub status is always at risk. We are not a “natural” hub, that status is not a given inalienable right. It is a privilege our prior generations earned, by exploiting our favourable position. Just look at Hong Kong, a hub status can be lost when conditions change. So what if a city has a good position, rivals can still arise and geopolitical changes can ruin it. What we need are locally rooted MNCs, founded by ambitious entrepreuneurs rather than greedy middlemen and rent seekers (typical SMC mindset). We need more of the likes of Grab and Shopee, whose founders aren’t even pure bred Singaporeans! You might ask, why does it matter if a MNC is rooted? Well, if a firm is here out of convenience, they can uproot just as easily and move their hubs to our future competitors, cementing our decline. Although a locally rooted firm can still outsource parts of its workforce, it can’t outsource them all without changing where it is based in. Even then, companies are still often reluctant to abandon their original home entirely (e.g., Dyson moved its global HQ to SG, but still retained many jobs in its original home in the UK). Singapore is a small city and our region is huge. Our firms do not need to monopolise the market for the region, we just need to extract a bit of their prosperity, and that can create many quality jobs for Singaporeans. If we depend on foreign firms, we are beholden to them, forever limited in what we can do to address our challenges. If we have our own strong firms, being capital owners instead of just labour providers, our country has a stronger position to make necessary policy changes when times are difficult. Two cities in Michigan, US, illustrate the difference being the home of owners and labour providers. Flint, once a large automobile manufacturing city, is today a sad miserable “slum”. Detroit, the home to many large American automobile companies, survived. Although changes in economic conditions have hurtbothcities, the one that was just a labour provider suffered most, as they lost their attractiveness and jobs pulled out, and was left with nothing. 66% of nominal value added is attributed to foreign MNCs, who only account for 33% of employment. This means on average, a MNC employee is 4 times as productive as a SME employee. Obviously, good jobs comes from MNCs, not SMEs. And as I had already mentioned, it’s not sufficient to just attract foreign MNCs, we need to build our own. Singapore needs to be the economic leader of SEA, not just the favoured “employee”. The government need to encourage entrepreuneurs, not just any businessmen. We don’t need more bosses with SME boss mindsets, forever limited to Singapore, because they cannot compete outside of Singapore’s cosy environment. And SMEs are not sufficient, because our market is too small. Personally, I don’t think we can afford to continue with the mindless pro-business mindset that allows some SMEs to be complacent, since the big boss (government) will bend backwards to shelter them. Some of them really should make away. Some SMEs will never grow beyond SG, because they are too addicted to the clutch the government gave them. Too sheltered and pampered.",329,the ministry of manpower isn't addressing the root cost of worsening job market.,t3_1mxtw9b,property

"I agree with your point. But, a significant contributor to that problem is the lax immigration policy, allowing companies to be so brazen with this. Which is funny, because the government did tighten policy and made it difficult for small companies to get foreign workers for their less well paid jobs. In theory, such a problem can be relatively easy to address. And worse come to worse, the government with its significant financial resources, can be a key shareholder (not necessarily a majority) in local MNCs and exert some influence. For example, nobody would expect Temasek owned Singtel to abandon Singapore. Sure, Singtel is profit driven, but they are still accountable to their shareholders, and the state’s sovereign wealth fund happens to hold a majority and have a lot of say. Or maybe the example of SBS Transit. The Singapore Labour Foundation (a stat board) isn’t even the majority shareholder of SBS’s parent, but somehow, somebody still managed to convince them to hire ex-generals like every other government linked companies. Wouldn’t that be a sign of having influence? And to make companies care about Singapore and Singaporeans, why not take a page out of the sustainable financing play book? Through various investment strategies, financing instruments, public-private partnerships, and what’s not, people managed to get profit driven entities worldwide to care about sustainability.

"Yes, your successful entrepreneurs have the tendency to have rich or at least well off, middle class parents.

Yes, they weren’t rich rich, but they were in solidly middle class families. Singapore was developing as late as in the 80s, a lot of our parents were blue collar workers with minimal education. It’s not just something to “fall back on” too, it’s also upbringing. Your parents richer/more educated, they would more likely be open to you exploring pet projects when you’re young because they understand the value of holistic education. Meanwhile, most of our blue collar parents would think that climbing the proverbial education and corporate ladder is the way.

We can have 75% of a team based elsewhere, outsourced, but at scale, even that 25% is going to generate a lot of jobs. For a foreign MNC, we are that outsourced team, disposable. For a Singapore based MNC that have taken root, we become that 25% that is hard to dislodge. Because Singapore is small, and because we are talking at scale, we don’t need to secure 100% of the jobs. We just need a fraction, a reliable fraction. And I highlighted both Grab and Shopee because both their founders are naturalised citizens.

"Read the comments in this topic and another recent similar topic about 'SG being a retail colony', and the common refrain observed is ""why pick on PRC retail food stores when there were previous/parallel waves of American/korean/jap food stalls""? The key difference is that the proliferation of such food stalls is part of a self-reinforcing loop that feeds a burgeoning PRC expat bubble. In other cultural food waves, the expat presence is not comparable to the current PRC bubble - one does not see the ""American/Koreans/Japs"" community everywhere. Second key difference is the minimal use of English language in their storefronts. menus, signages, apps and communications medium with the customer. Granted the early Jap and Korean restaurants could be guilty of this as well but the PRC version almost makes local feel that the target consumer audience is almost exclusively... the PRC expat/community bubble. Locals patronising such stores are bonus revenue. Thirdly, another common refrain is to ""let market forces decide, and sooner or later the overproliferation will curb itself"" - let consumers vote with their dollar. Sure,but what if you - the local - were never their target audience to begin with ? How then would market forces decide - if such forces are already being distorted in the first placeby 1) the disproportionally huge presence of the PRC expat bubble here, and 2) the PRC-headquartered businesses needing to expand into overseas market because of 'money-laundering' concerns or because of the stagnating domestic economy? Market forces does not work or are slow to work, because locals cannot move the needle, even if they vote with their wallets. These are IMHO, what makes the current PRC food wave/tsunami so distinctively different from other cultural food waves. Not happy with the PRC restaurant?

"My personal anecdote is once I was buying a drink at a new estate (Tengah). The aunty in front at the self checkout lane was visibly quite confused about how to pay for veggies at the self checkout, and a helpful indian staff reached out to offer her help, telling her ""I can help you tag the veggies, just pass them to me"". Her response? It was just clear confusion. She did not understand a single word a young Indian worker with mostly neutral slang and accent was saying. She walked away and went to the counter queue to look for a chinese staff. I thought for a moment, given her attire was stereotypically not local (sun visor, choice of clothes), and her complete lack of English skills, maybe she is just staying here temporarily. But Tengah is clearly illegal to rent right now since its all under MOP.

For them the issue is late information- just in this week already her boss told her not to come in on one day because the vendors were all toldon that morningthat students are leaving early for outside activity. Supposedly the reason is that in case of bad weather, the outside activity would be canceled and the parents would be concerned that the students don’t have any food when staying in school. But of course that doesn’t help when vendors have already been cooking since 4, 5am and have a lot of food to clear.

Frankly Singaporean children had it good while there were operators passionate enough to hang on. But it's as you said, it was only a matter of time till most of them throw in the towel. Thus allowing central kitchens to move in, as they are the only ones who survive at those prices and margins. While that meal is 5 bucks, which seems alot compared to standard hawker food, the canteen business is alot weaker than your typical hawker which means the margins needs to be higher to survive. Meaning the ingredient value will be lower. As the public and the rest of the commentators here gets outraged that a faceless corporation does not really care as much as the passionate canteen operators of the past. Perhaps it's time to be reminded we set the conditions for this to happen. We didn't want compromise on price and pay those canteen operators what they need to survive. Which is way above 5 bucks.

"I look at it another way, if we go back to basics of cost vs price. Is $5 too low to charge, what about $4, or $3? Etc. Then based on that what can vendors provide or can't and why? Then solve those issues. Bec I think $4-5 is more than a fair price and I certainly don't want my children to think it should be more. And isn't the benchmark the prices we have at coffeeshops and hawker centres? The issue is then the sales volume and requirements imposed by MOE (in discussion with MOH?). Time to get to work and think. Solve those issues. Open to public, communicate better, reduce requirements. Security concerns? Fix them - stagger timings for public and block off the canteen as an example. I think the catering approach is fine....but maybe ask hawkers or private caterers to try. Has it been planned for multiple schools to address volume? I don't know what it will eventually look like, but it deserves more thought. Maybe these have all been considered....but I do find that hard to believe. I must admit the reference point I'm using are the food prices available in hawker centres and coffee shops and I feel that must be a reasonable benchmark.

"I upvoted because you're right. My comment only highlighted one dimension in this- price, all things being equal. As you said there are ways to maintain price while ensuring the canteen hawkers can survive, if other compromises can be made. People can make compromises, but often only after they acknowledge there are limitations to the current situation. Herein lies the rub, scroll through comments, and this comment I replied to was the first to acknowledge the situation canteen hawkers face. I am in total agreement with your methodology. As you said we can start with the price - which is to use hawkerfare as a benchmark. But we should be realistic that canteen hawkers have to meet a higher nutritional standard than regular hawkers. This means compromising on taste from the onset, as nutritious and tasty food usually means quality ingredients. Unless MOE or the government intervenes and brings in suppliers to offer discount rates on quality ingredients to canteen hawkers. As you mentioned opening the school canteens and turning them into community canteens is a solution, and allowing them to operate during term breaks to generate volume for the hawkers. There will definitely be opposition from parents to opening the school premises to strangers. The aspect of security is not trivial to solve. It's not as simple as just staggered timings, the school needs additional physical security. A large majority of the parents needs to care enough about this to push the school into adopting this and steamroll opposing parents. Another possibility is to pre-purchase the meals, such that you generate a fixed number of servings for the hawker to optimise while minimising waste and overheads as the original comment mentioned. This may also mean reduced choices for your children. In this instance, you as the parent needs to play your part, which is commit to purchasing the meals, even if your children do not enjoy them. As I have relations who are teachers. I will bring up another persective, which is the MOE and the schools don't see this as a  problem - Nutrition is being provided at an affordable price. It's subjective in how one views the food as edible or not. Halimah's post basically implies this. The teachers are too overloaded with more pressing issues to spend time on this. This arrangement of set it once and forget it for the year/s with 1 caterer is ideal for administration by the school. It's not that central kitchens are inherently bad. If the parents are willing to fork out more, or if MOE and the schools are willing to top up and subsidise more. It's not delusional to expect better quality. I think people are forgetting SATS also caters for airline first and business classes, as well as the airport lounges. They can deliver decent food, much better than what is shown here. KF Seetoh touched on topic briefly on YahLahBut His take is that central kitchen are not bad with certain conditions. Which in my opinion also an acknowledgement just how dire school canteen hawker situation is. He straight up admits that it's not a sustainable business even with an almost zero rent.",6,Halimah Yacob says Hwa Chong food looks good to her,t3_1q66vfs,prices

"Definitely agree. However, this has some implications as well due to how our society has changed over time. For example, alot of the parents in the past (not all) are single income families with the mother being stay-at-home mum. This brings some flexibility for one of the partners to spend the effort to take care of their kids' needs such as transport etc. Nowadays, its hard to find a couple that is willing to forgo one of their incomes (unless they are rich which makes this point about COE moot) hence a need to bring kids to school and then to work, vice-versa, time consuming and possibly affecting their work, not to mention their quality of life.

"ABSD applies for individual buyers. ABCD, if applied on buyers, will have limited impact because most people only own 1 car. For people who can afford to own multiple cars, the additional charges are unlikely to affect their choice. Also, since 1 person can only be in 1 car at a time, limiting the number of cars purchased by a person does not control the car population on the road at all, since at least 1 car will always be in the carpark. Now, if we apply ABCD on a household as you suggested, the problem of fairness and needs come into the picture. You are unfairly discriminating against large or multi-generation families living together. Even for a small family, there could be unique needs such as both adults being sales people who need cars for their work. Why should they pay more compared to another family who has a car purely for convenience? With all these, I am of the opinion that what the govt is doing today is what is most fair based on the resources we have. The distance based COE that is being planned for is also a good initiative to make COEs more fair. What they can do better is to further improve public transport, so that more people prefer public transport to cars. We keep hearing of breakdowns and packed trains, which do nothing to help encourage people to take more public transport.

But the COE value is still reflected as the bid price so if they should scrap the car, they only get back a portion of the original bid price. Make it illegal for someone to drive a car not tied to your own address. That means, u can drive the car as long as your address reflects the same address as the car registration. Why ? Currently those who own multiple multiple cars are those staying in large landed houses and condos. Very often, these cars are roughly the same price as the COE itself or more. You make them pay a COE way over the actual machine price, the govt coffers grow if they continue, or they actually stop and COE will slowly come down. What this means for us commoners? Over time, as demand for COEs dwindle, car buyers who only intend to own one car will find it more affordable. The number of cars are still regulated based on the COE quota. What are the difficulties in achieving this? How do we tax companies? do we slap on a flat % across the board? right now, ride share and private hire companies are taking up a good number of COEs per bidding afaik. i may be wrong. How do we enforce the address thing?",12,Jamus Lim and SM Lee on COE system,t3_1m16d1u,prices

"Good question. Let me preface by saying that it is difficult to separatepolicyand the actualstate of affairsbecause of fundamental physical or cultural differences between the two countries (and in the case of the US, State). For instance, I don't think it's fair to fault PAP for the horrid weather, though quality of life would skyrocket if it was ""fixed"". Other issues are a bit of a gray area, for example, overcrowding. Singapore is small, so obviously it will be more crowded than your average city. But you could also make the case that unbridled immigration policy played a part in this. At any rate, I'd readily admit it is hard to make a direct apples to apples comparison on most policies, and at some point you'd have to be prepared to make a judgement call. I'd also focus on the more controversial things... to spice things up. The first overrated thing I realized was transport. I know it's crazy, but I found the NYC subway not nearly as bad as I thought. Gross as heck, but it got me to where I wanted to. And fast, thanks to express trains. For a tourist, it's absolutely terrible and confusing, but as a resident, I found it actually okay. Upon returning to SG, I found our MRTs more crowded than the NYC subway, and tbh, more unbearable simply because of the duration of the journey! The second thing was... education. Unbelievable, isn't it? Now this is one of those gray areas because I didn't go through it myself, nor do I have kids there. When I first moved to the States, I was pretty proud of SG's education system. Maybe it wasn't the most inspiring, but it certainly provided a lower bound, right? All I heard about the US education system was how decrepit it was, e.g., with public school teachers having to fork out money to buy their markers etc. And school shootings. But when I look at outcomes, Singapore seems behind ineverythingexcept ... tests. It's very strange. We have some really smart people academically, and they are certainly doing well. But Singaporeans seem to have a really low upper bound in their career. Even those who move abroad. I'm not talking about Nobel prizes or that kind of achievement. I'm just talking about the top 20% or so. The fact that we are fawning over Chew Shou Zi says something. Something about our education system is neutering our brightest students. Or god forbid there is something that US's (public or private?) schooling system is doing right. The last one is industrial policy. This is an area I think both the PAP and opposition are shying away from, because neither has a solution, and certainly not me. I think our companies are mollycoddled by the G. LocalandMNCs. Wait isn't that strange? Isn't that a description reserved for our decadent youngsters? Hear me out. It is no secret that many of our industries are very, very inefficient. A classic case is construction. The construction industry here isextremelymanpower inefficient, hence the large number of migrant, temporary workers. What does this have to do with the G? Isn't it just the free market? Normally, the G would limit immigration to force companies to improve, especially with respect to labour and immigration. But when push comes to shove, italwaysgets soft hearted and allows the status quo. Here's another example: integration of academia, government and industry. I used to be in academia in the US. There, there was a very clear pipeline of blue sky, translational to commercial product. Despite all the bluster we are used to in the US, the research front (except maybe in the past 1-2 months) was actually really well done. There's a reason why they are an innovation powerhouse; these components of their innovation engine are all churning in unison, from the way government grants are disbursed, all the way to immigration policy. Here... we have a ton of weird grants, projects, scholarships that are all over the place. Companies are expecting plug-and-play employees from universities. There isn't a lot of coherence between labour, education, and industrial requirements. Are there things that I prefer in SG? Yes. Healthcare system is a mess in the US. And perhaps surprisingly, I think that limiting protests to HLP is a good idea. Don't get me started on the drug policies in the US. (Now if you trawl through my post history you'd notice housing is my top election issue, but I didn't bring it up here. Why? Because I think it's unfair to compare the two country's housing policies given they are so physically different. But in case you were wondering, a single average resale flat can get me a entire house in one of the cities I stayed in, and easily!)",16,An open letter to Singapore from a young Singaporean.,t3_1kakrfi,CPF

Transportation - I do think there is more to improve, although I might look towards Japan, Korea, China as targets. The misstep was privatising a public good, only to have to take it back later on, and having to spend a lot more to make it good enough again.
Education - Definitely needs a shift away from memorisation.  But it's a huge change management exercise as parents & teachers alike need to acknowledge tests isn't the way to go.

"It's definitely not too late to start over, 26 is so young. I think you should finish the management trainee programme and ""graduate"" with a good title and then start looking for roles here in Singapore. I've noticed that there are some roles popping up that require Korean fluency (based in SG), so that might be a good fit for you. Even if you feel that your technical skillset is narrow, I think that the management trainee programme and the departmental rotations makes it easier for you to position yourself as a generalist and that's something companies definitely can appreciate. Stay warm and all the best with your decision. Don't stress about whether it's too late or if you've wasted time. It's fine to tap out 6 years into building the dream you had at 20y/o and realise that it's not for the present you.

"Ok I'll bite. Based on this census as of Jun 2024 (https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-population-604-million-non-resident-increase-4627281), Singapore had 6.08M people, including - 3.64M Citizens, 0.54M PRs, 100K Students, 300K LTVPs & DPs, 280K Domestic Workers, 430K Construction & Shipyard Workers, 390K Other Work Permit Holders (e.g. Manufacturing, Services), and about 390K White Collar Professionals of all visa types (S-Pass, EP). I'm going to assume you are not going to cut PRs, so that leaves 1.4M foreigners that you need to cut to get us to 1M foreigners total (or approximately 75% of all non-PR foreigners). How are you intending to cut from these buckets? Even if you cut every single Work Permit, S Pass & EP holder, decimating our entire manufacturing and construction industries in the process, you still have 190K that you need to cut from either dependents & spouses (including many foreign spouses of Singaporeans), students, or domestic workers.

"Thanks for biting. I am going to firstly preface that prominent academics like Prof Tay Kheng Soon argues that we have enough land if we engage in 3D planning. I agree with him on this. My worry is that there's not going to be enough jobs. PMET retrenchments are at all time highs since we recorded this statistic since 1988. The AI displacement is real. First: I don't advocate to shaft PRs - it's a good way to filter and bring in the best Singaporeans. But that number might not be this high if we encounter even more challenging AI disruptions. COVID showed that a good number of 6.2% decline could bring us down to around 0.5m PRs. Second: Based on current TFR and Birth rate of 0.97 it does look like we will have to plan for around 2.9 to 3.1 million Singaporeans by 2040. But we usually have an excess of PRs applications that we can use to gradually stabilise the current citizen population to about 4M. Third: I think domestic workers will be about 30-50K when 2040 comes around. This is the 'crazy' part people are telling me and I accept it. My counter is that one should research how fast the progression of humanoid robots are right now. They are being deployed in factories and the work of Optimus, Figure, Unitree etc is growing exponentially. This would also bring shipyard/manufacturing/services workers down significantly in the next 15 years. This is just a base estimate, but i would guess that at least 200K of these jobs. AI and LLMs are already starting to really eat into the white collar professionals too, so I wouldn't be surprised to see it decline 10-15% in the next 15 years.

Any legitimate suggestion to address a societal or systemic issue gets questioned, “where does the money come from?”, as though claiming that the people who made these suggestions want to raid the reserves and impact the future generations. But when it comes to these vouchers, it seems ok to be giving them out on a fixed schedule year after year. These vouchers (rightly pointed out by OP and commenters) are not even targeted to people who need it the most. Every household, no matter how large or wealthy gets the same amount. “The CDC vouchers, meant to help households manage cost-of-living challenges” The poor get hit by cost of living challenges more than the rich, but both get the same amount.

"On the contrary I think the vouchers are a good initiative. It's not easy to institute selective tourist and foreigner tax. Instead, by taxing everyone the same and dispersing a kickback to the citizens, it circumvents this issue. Furthermore, dispersing as cash would mean that for many the money doesn't go back to the economy. By doing this it ensures that the money does reenter the economy. Additionally, the rich citizens can't complain that they aren't included, they are given the same vouchers even though they have larger homes and taxes. It is their choice whether they want to use it to go kopitiam or not, but if they don't it is their own taiji, they can't say the govt didn't care about them.",93,Opinion: CDC Vouchers should be per pax not per household,t3_1km41o6,economy

Why can’t we use the data that’s already being used for CDC? it also reduces overhead and you don’t have to wait 3 months and submit 5 forms to get your vouchers. I don’t remember having to submit 5 forms and wait 3 months to process my CHAS card application. Everything is automatic from IRAS. Of course there will be a question of people under declaring their income, but that’s another story to tell. Processing and sorting families by SES costs money and labour, you might end up with less handouts for the same budget. It doesn’t magically happen. Everything is already pretty much automatic. CHAS card is on an application basis, but many households still applied because there are subsidies. If we were to get these CDC vouchers only if we confirm the composition of our households, everyone wouldn’t mind doing it. Of course there will be elderly who live alone and have no idea how to do it online, that’s what community Centers are for.

"This is a problem of re-allocation of resources. So it seems reasonable to expect those who are well off to contribute more while those who are more needy to receive more but reality does not work that way. There would be people whodoes not feel happy about being made to pay more taxes while not getting anything. So there has to be mechanisms in the re-allocation processes to create a sense of agency. “ie you are paying more because you want to”. So the govt relies to a certain degree on tax relief/rebate on charitable contributions, giving people the choice of contributing more to society should they choose to. Same thing for voucher handouts. If the middle class and above gets nothing, there would be disgruntled ppl constantly ranting about paying more taxes and not getting anything. So there are some schemes that give more to needy and there is the cdc scheme to give every sg households the same amount. So if you are really rich and feeling charitable, there is an option for you not to claim or contribute to a charity of your choice. It gives rich people a sense that they are also getting something and a sense that they can do more should they choose to. Point is not everyone think the same way about paying taxes and receiving help. So there has to be a range of schemes to cover this range of sentiments. No govt can make everyone happy all the time.

"I don't know the exact inner workings, but just let me surmise a guess. The issue here is in the way the funds are disbursed. GST vouchers are straightforward. Go straight to your bank account. No drama involved. With CDC vouchers and chas, it's not cash, so someone has to basically make the claim to Govt after receiving the voucher/card. For chas it is done by skilled medical labour, basically your nurses and admin assistants who will have to make sure of your identity and make sure your claim is legit. All your data is looked up, and the claim is made after verification. In this way, govt actually offload most of the admin work to the clinics and hospital staff to do. With CDC vouchers, the people accepting your vouchers are hawkers and mama shop owners. There's no way they can deal with a complicated claim system that requires identity verification. It has to be fuss free and straightforward to claim because, your typical CDC voucher acceptor is not going to be able to handle admin work. If there's any sort of complication here, govt likely will have to earmark manpower to manage it, rather than rely on the claimants like how they do for Chas.

"Bro that is the point. There is no account. With the current CDC voucher system there is no such thing as an account. The QR codes are simply one off codes that allow redemption. That's why if you give other people your link, they can redeem it and you can no longer use. Because there is no account. It's more like a Google/Apple gift card. If there needs to be an account then that's a lot of overhead already, similar to a Chas like system. And my guess is this method of disbursement is the reason why the govt has simply given the same set of vouchers to every household. It just makes things easier and no need to really track who has which voucher. Anyway we are going too deep in with this already. I honestly dunno if I'm even describing the system correctly. As I mentioned I'm just giving my two cents and guessing, I have no idea if the challenges I put forth are actually what made them go this route, there is no point in debating something that may not even be really what's happening behind the scenes.

CDC vouchers are to cope with the cost of living in general! for core inflation of 2.7% last year (which excludes housing and COE prices, so I'm being generous here), that's less than 30k of spending per household.

"Good question. Let me preface by saying that it is difficult to separatepolicyand the actualstate of affairsbecause of fundamental physical or cultural differences between the two countries (and in the case of the US, State). For instance, I don't think it's fair to fault PAP for the horrid weather, though quality of life would skyrocket if it was ""fixed"". Other issues are a bit of a gray area, for example, overcrowding. Singapore is small, so obviously it will be more crowded than your average city. But you could also make the case that unbridled immigration policy played a part in this. At any rate, I'd readily admit it is hard to make a direct apples to apples comparison on most policies, and at some point you'd have to be prepared to make a judgement call. I'd also focus on the more controversial things... to spice things up. The first overrated thing I realized was transport. I know it's crazy, but I found the NYC subway not nearly as bad as I thought. Gross as heck, but it got me to where I wanted to. And fast, thanks to express trains. For a tourist, it's absolutely terrible and confusing, but as a resident, I found it actually okay. Upon returning to SG, I found our MRTs more crowded than the NYC subway, and tbh, more unbearable simply because of the duration of the journey! The second thing was... education. Unbelievable, isn't it? Now this is one of those gray areas because I didn't go through it myself, nor do I have kids there. When I first moved to the States, I was pretty proud of SG's education system. Maybe it wasn't the most inspiring, but it certainly provided a lower bound, right? All I heard about the US education system was how decrepit it was, e.g., with public school teachers having to fork out money to buy their markers etc. And school shootings. But when I look at outcomes, Singapore seems behind ineverythingexcept ... tests. It's very strange. We have some really smart people academically, and they are certainly doing well. But Singaporeans seem to have a really low upper bound in their career. Even those who move abroad. I'm not talking about Nobel prizes or that kind of achievement. I'm just talking about the top 20% or so. The fact that we are fawning over Chew Shou Zi says something. Something about our education system is neutering our brightest students. Or god forbid there is something that US's (public or private?) schooling system is doing right. The last one is industrial policy. This is an area I think both the PAP and opposition are shying away from, because neither has a solution, and certainly not me. I think our companies are mollycoddled by the G. LocalandMNCs. Wait isn't that strange? Isn't that a description reserved for our decadent youngsters? Hear me out. It is no secret that many of our industries are very, very inefficient. A classic case is construction. The construction industry here isextremelymanpower inefficient, hence the large number of migrant, temporary workers. What does this have to do with the G? Isn't it just the free market? Normally, the G would limit immigration to force companies to improve, especially with respect to labour and immigration. But when push comes to shove, italwaysgets soft hearted and allows the status quo. Here's another example: integration of academia, government and industry. I used to be in academia in the US. There, there was a very clear pipeline of blue sky, translational to commercial product. Despite all the bluster we are used to in the US, the research front (except maybe in the past 1-2 months) was actually really well done. There's a reason why they are an innovation powerhouse; these components of their innovation engine are all churning in unison, from the way government grants are disbursed, all the way to immigration policy. Here... we have a ton of weird grants, projects, scholarships that are all over the place. Companies are expecting plug-and-play employees from universities. There isn't a lot of coherence between labour, education, and industrial requirements. Are there things that I prefer in SG? Yes. Healthcare system is a mess in the US. And perhaps surprisingly, I think that limiting protests to HLP is a good idea. Don't get me started on the drug policies in the US. (Now if you trawl through my post history you'd notice housing is my top election issue, but I didn't bring it up here. Why? Because I think it's unfair to compare the two country's housing policies given they are so physically different. But in case you were wondering, a single average resale flat can get me a entire house in one of the cities I stayed in, and easily!)",16,An open letter to Singapore from a young Singaporean.,t3_1kakrfi,inflation

Transportation - I do think there is more to improve, although I might look towards Japan, Korea, China as targets. The misstep was privatising a public good, only to have to take it back later on, and having to spend a lot more to make it good enough again.
Education - Definitely needs a shift away from memorisation.  But it's a huge change management exercise as parents & teachers alike need to acknowledge tests isn't the way to go. For the longest time, education policies were around producing graduates with the knowledge and skills to support an industry, like when Chemical & Bio-engineering was the fade so many courses in our universities.
