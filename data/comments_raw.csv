"94 and a half years left on the lease, someone earnt alot off their BTO... Remember when we were complaining about 1million dollar HDBs?",310,Clementi sees a new record with its first S$1.5M HDB resale,t3_1q53g6o,HDB
"Inflation and the concept of compounding is easy enough to understand. What people still don’t understand is that the large numbers we have used as anchors will very soon be irrelevant. Remember “Who wants to be a millionaire”? It came out in 1998. The prize is still $1m - but that is just over $500k in today’s dollars. The first $1m HDB was sold in 2012. We hit $1.65m in 2025 (13 years later). At the same rate, we’ll hit $2m in 2029. That’s just 4 years.",127,Clementi sees a new record with its first S$1.5M HDB resale,t3_1q53g6o,HDB
"But have incomes kept pace? At Median and at the ""market clearing"" rate of less skilled labour (aka the SME and F&B jobs that e2i often has on hand, and are often the only ones they have available) The entire world is facing an reduction in affordability of housing, and it seems we are following suit.",83,Clementi sees a new record with its first S$1.5M HDB resale,t3_1q53g6o,HDB
"Median salary in 2012: $3480, median salary in 2025: $5500, nominal increase of 58% $1 million in 2012, $1.65 million in 2025, nominal increase of 65% So not really kept up, but it’s closer than I thought.",67,Clementi sees a new record with its first S$1.5M HDB resale,t3_1q53g6o,HDB
"What’s more important is the median starting income, since that’s not skewed by older workers who already have houses. Just using fresh grad incomes (because that the only stats we have), it was $3050 in 2012, and $4500 in 2025. A 47.5% increase. Not that this is only the fresh grad population - when we factor in the rest of the population, do we think it would be lower, or higher?",42,Clementi sees a new record with its first S$1.5M HDB resale,t3_1q53g6o,HDB
"Looked at some data, so going to adjust my views abit. Lets use the SRX Index for HDB 4 rooms rather than top prices, because those can be skewed by stuff like pricing for executive apartments being different than the stuff people usually buy. The Index for July 2012 at 143.5, for July 2025 at 213.1. So an increase of 48.5%. So, the argument that Lawrence Wong is making that increasing HDB prices are driven by increasing incomes does hold some water. This is why I talked about the ""market clearing jobs"". If someone is able to earn median income and keep earning median income throughout their lives then things may be ok.  However if they are unable to keep up due to employment issues, then it gets quite painful (especially if they need to delay their HDB purchase due to single or late marriage - which causes savings wipe out due to HDB appreciation). However this moves the politics of land price onto the politics of employment. Forcing Singaporeans to intensify, upskill and seek more lucrative employment - with Singapore already being an expensive late stage post-industrial economy - each increase in salary isn't exactly easy to fight for. For those who have not yet bought housing yet and fixed in a mortgage, there is a sense then of ""running to stay in place"" or a ""fear of being left behind"". For those who have bought housing already and fixed in a mortgage, then things can be quite chill. Which is an annoying for democracy because owners tend to outnumber buyers.",32,Clementi sees a new record with its first S$1.5M HDB resale,t3_1q53g6o,HDB
"At the same time fresh grad income also isn’t particularly fair, since fresh grads aren’t buying resale homes. In fact, older workers are probably the ones buying these homes, young people are applying for BTOs. Median age of homebuyers buying these $1 million+ homes is 40 years old.Median age in Singapore is 43.2.",20,Clementi sees a new record with its first S$1.5M HDB resale,t3_1q53g6o,HDB
"Who needs toto when you have BTO. Their profit is probably 800k, why dont i just quit my job and go for a bto with max subsidies",18,Clementi sees a new record with its first S$1.5M HDB resale,t3_1q53g6o,HDB
"That is fair. I did the 2012 to 2025 because its a peak to peak analysis. This does give proper credit to the cooling measures done over the 2012-2020 period that kept the prices plateaued. So 2025 buyers are very disadvantaged compared to 2019 buyers (who got to enjoy the plateau effect to the full intensity), but are about just as disadvantaged as 2012 buyers. With any luck we can have a suite of policies to replicate that price plateau again",13,Clementi sees a new record with its first S$1.5M HDB resale,t3_1q53g6o,HDB
Yeah - but it’s not just housing that has outpaced wages. Education and healthcare too. Those are major expense: as well. It’s only going to get worse.,12,Clementi sees a new record with its first S$1.5M HDB resale,t3_1q53g6o,HDB
"But that largely because the resale index dip from w
2012 to 2020 after govt added cooling measures such as ABSD. 57% increase over the last 4 years is huge and I doubt most people receive 57% increase in income over the last 4 years. Naturally we are free to cherry pick any of the date to paint our picture.",9,Clementi sees a new record with its first S$1.5M HDB resale,t3_1q53g6o,HDB
We shouldnt even be following suit in the first place since the our govt has control over public housing. Other govts do not have the same setup. Unfortunately the current govt rarely takes firm action. They've been monitoring this for yearsss.,6,Clementi sees a new record with its first S$1.5M HDB resale,t3_1q53g6o,HDB
Better odds too,5,Clementi sees a new record with its first S$1.5M HDB resale,t3_1q53g6o,HDB
"Good point… I think we’re making 2 separate but valid points here. I’m demonstrating that the most expensive public housing is getting further and further away from each generation. You’re showing that it’s also moving away from people in their 40s, but at a slower rate. In any case, we’re both showing that things are still skewing to the right…",4,Clementi sees a new record with its first S$1.5M HDB resale,t3_1q53g6o,HDB
Percentage of graduates would have gone up. So the overall increase in salary should have gone up by more than 47.5%.,4,Clementi sees a new record with its first S$1.5M HDB resale,t3_1q53g6o,HDB
I think resale flat prices have increased ~40% within the last few years alone. Quite obvious that it's impossible for salary of the majority to keep pace with it.,4,Clementi sees a new record with its first S$1.5M HDB resale,t3_1q53g6o,HDB
"If you earn median salary you can BTO, both as a single and as a 2 median income household. I think in terms of looking at affordability it should really be tracking BTO prices, not resell prices.",2,Clementi sees a new record with its first S$1.5M HDB resale,t3_1q53g6o,HDB

"Precisely. Keeping quiet about issues works in favour of the govt because all those who don't keep up with politics will not even realise there's a problem and PAP gets to maintain their whiter than white image, and PAP simply get reelected. The people have to be sufficiently ignorant and simple minded for the govt to pull it off consistently though.

"Unpopular opinion but we shouldn't just vilify the current batch of homeowners who sell their BTOs after MOP. I'm all against BTOs / HDBs being an ""investment"" to be flipped for profits, and I've personally acted accordingly (buying a home that's right sized for us and we have no intentions to flip to buy a condo or whatever). But that said, the villians aren't the individual homeowners who sell their BTOs after MOP. Do they contribute to the problem? Yeah sure, in a small way. However even if one were altrustic to the point of selling it for the price they paid, the seller of their next home wouldn't give them a discount and they'll be stuck without a home. Fuck those who buy with the intention of flipping. However, let's point fingers in the right direction (changing the mind of one homeowner to sell below the current market rate wouldn't change the course of the market): the property agents who push the flip BTO / HDB / sell one buy two, as well as the HDB system (under the government from the 00s or before to even now) that perpetuate the system. I therefore make the argument that if you're angry with the resale price of HDBs, if you're a single who is pissed at the cost of housing and the unfairness of it all, point your efforts in the right direction. The HDB system and the people who are in charge. Start with speaking out against the system even when you've gotten your BTO, speak to others who just crucify the homeowners without thinking about the system that causes the homeowners to act the way they do. Even lobby your MPs or the political party you support to push for reform for the system. Perhaps to launch more BTOs, perhaps to reform property advertisements by realtors, or some other innovative ways you may come up with.

"Your assumption is that the gap between public and private housing will stay the same. But think about it, incremental new supply for HDBs are all lower priced than prevailing resale. Whereas incremental new supply for condos (new launch) are multiples HIGHER priced than prevailing resale. Furthermore, in the last 4yrs, HDB prices have actually appreciated more than condos.

No because I don't see the benefits to paying so much to stay in Macpherson. It doesn't mean that others will view it the same way as me.

I haven’t really done the math tbh but I would assume a combined income of $10k would be able to afford it and flip it for $1.1m-$1.2m at least when it MOPs in (I think) 4 years’ time.

"The decrease of flat size is a myth according to government. Other than the period of 1995-2000 when the HDB built 5 rm flats which were 120-130sqm, 5 room flats have always been around 110-120 sqm, so the Macpherson 5 room is actually in the middle. The issue is just that there are fewer and fewer 5 room flats to go around. And last time got weird stuff like EA, DBSS whatever nonsense. But this is a double-edged sword so it is difficult to complain about it, it means there are more 3 and 4 rooms for lower-income folks to buy more comfortably. Anyway, the point is that the best bto 5 room flat in the best location is affordable for a 2-income, median-income local uni grad couple. I think that is really damn good already cos this the top end of public housing and you dont need to be like double law degree or something to be able to afford comfortably.",-2,Prime HDB flats still oversubscribed under new framework but demand eases with higher supply,t3_1psoxvf,HDB
"Or just reduce the leasehold time maybe to 60 years. The thing is the price decay with 99 years, the first 20 years it appreciates more than it decays, and since it is really leveraged and unlikely to go down in value (since you are buying below market price with bto), it’s very lucrative investment.

"Not sure about this one, but there are a lot of retarded bus lanes, which gives like 1 car length of dotted lines before a major slip road and cars have to queue up next to the bus lane and then force their way into that dotted area, which means the buses will be blocked at the dotted line area if the flow is blocked AND they cannot drive around this block because they are hemmed in by a continuous queue of cars in the next lane. Car lite doesnt have to mean unusable roads. Fire engines and ambulances use the roads too.

"Ok, so just some background on this particular bus lane. Before it was converted into dotted yellow lines, it was already a pointless bus lane, cos it was a dotted line for a few metres after the filter lane, followed by a very short stretch of straight yellow line, and then it becomes dotted the whole way again. The issue was, cars found it very difficult to filter from Bidadari Park Drive to Upper Serangoon Road during peak hours as they had to filter two lanes at one go. This resulted in quite a lengthy backlog along Bidadari Park Drive in the morning AND buses plying along Bidadari Park Drive ended up being delayed too. For those cars who dared to venture out, some got stuck in the bus lane trying to filter into the non-bus lane. They essentially blocked the whole bus lane although the whole lane ahead was completely clear. And you have to remember they had to filter out just cos of that small stretch of solid yellow line which ends up becoming dotted again. So buses got stuck behind such cars because of the solid yellow line. Of course some cars got pressured and just drove ahead in the bus lane anyway but LTA likes to station enforcement officers there as well lol. Anyway, if they are going to the expressway they are forced to turn back to the dotted yellow line anyway... And those who are going towards bendemeer have to eventually filter out anyway. Just that now they have more opportunity to gain speed and filter out rather than get stuck there and depend on the goodwill of drivers. Just giving some context as to this change. I don't think if affects the car lite vision or what.",34,Upper Serangoon Rd bus lane removed,t3_1q62qrd,BTO

Not to mention, the tailback in the estate meant that bus services were being held up as well. This solves most of the problems in one step. If you are talking about the yellow boxes with an outward arrow, these are completely useless in my experience. They are not enforced, unlike bus lanes where you occasionally have an officer camping with a camera Unfortunately 99% of the drivers I've seen at these boxes aren't as considerate as you. Thank you. However to be fair, I think it's just a normal human perception issue where we notice bad stuff, but don't take note of all the good stuff. That being said, I have seen LTA officers checking on these, it's really not necessary. We just need dash cam footage from the busses to highlight to TP/LTA anyone who doesn't so do.

"I think it's also important to understand that this issue is a result of the bus lane's position. It blocks traffic (and traffic blocks the buses) because the bus lane is on the side of the road where turning cars interfere with it. On the other hand, if the bus lane was in the median of the road like in Jakarta, Mexico City, Seoul etc etc etc, the bus lane wouldn't be in the way of turning vehicles. Instead of taking the opportunity to pilot median bus lanes, LTA took the easy (and shit) way out of removing the bus lane altogether.
