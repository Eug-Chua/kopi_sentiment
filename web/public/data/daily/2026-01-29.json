I'm paranoid so I check it every 10 minutes anyway so I'm not even at risk but it always felt like this could happen. Like what if I forget? It's not like I take note of every check I do. I can't say, \"well I know I definitely showed it to the officer even if I don't remember, so I must have lost it after that.\"",

Since then, I've legit only seen the system active half the time I pass through the airport no matter which terminal it is, and of the other half of the time I've had the privilege to use it, it's slower than scanning passport and contributes to congestion, especially at T1 departure which is slow to begin with. The most annoying is when I'm let through the first gate and then it tells me to wait for a secondary check from the one officer doing the same thing for the other 20 gates, which wasn't a thing with passports. Surely you've encountered similar issues since you've used it so much. My experience hasn't changed since a full year ago and I don't know why it seems to be a me thing.",

Since then, I've legit only seen the system active half the time I pass through the airport no matter which terminal it is, and of the other half of the time I've had the privilege to use it, it's slower than scanning passport and contributes to congestion, especially at T1 departure which is slow to begin with. The most annoying is when I'm let through the first gate and then it tells me to wait for a secondary check from the one officer doing the same thing for the other 20 gates, which wasn't a thing with passports. Surely you've encountered similar issues since you've used it so much. My experience hasn't changed since a full year ago and I don't know why it seems to be a me thing.",
