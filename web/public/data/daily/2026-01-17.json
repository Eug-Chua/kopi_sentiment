Cross contamination, humane slaughter etc that’s the supplier problem. Unless you want to open a production. Other countries also have their own body to check on halal practices. For Singapore stalls, the auditors will just check on the halal certifications for ALL of your ingredients. If you get your chicken from a supplier, owner’s job is to ask for the halal certification from the supplier. Doesn’t matter from which country. There are different kinds of cert for different kind of businesses. It doesn’t cost a lot. Even the halal course for the staff to attend can be done online. The problem is not the costs, if they want to, they can afford it. The problem is applying for the cert, responding to emails, correcting the issues the auditors pointed out, administrative tasks etc, a pair of elderly makcik pakcik or a one man show will definitely have problems applying for it. Nothing against Muslim owned businesses just saying people only focusing the costs but that’s not the only problem when it comes to application. Can take up to 9-12 months to get approved.",

Cross contamination, humane slaughter etc that’s the supplier problem. Unless you want to open a production. Other countries also have their own body to check on halal practices. For Singapore stalls, the auditors will just check on the halal certifications for ALL of your ingredients. If you get your chicken from a supplier, owner’s job is to ask for the halal certification from the supplier. Doesn’t matter from which country. There are different kinds of cert for different kind of businesses. It doesn’t cost a lot. Even the halal course for the staff to attend can be done online. The problem is not the costs, if they want to, they can afford it. The problem is applying for the cert, responding to emails, correcting the issues the auditors pointed out, administrative tasks etc, a pair of elderly makcik pakcik or a one man show will definitely have problems applying for it. Nothing against Muslim owned businesses just saying people only focusing the costs but that’s not the only problem when it comes to application. Can take up to 9-12 months to get approved.",
