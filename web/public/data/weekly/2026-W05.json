However, I have the alternative of taking other buses to go to Clementi MRT instead, which I normally do not choose as I am headed eastbound. So without the app telling me the next bus timing, I waited... and waited... and waited.. and 20 mins later, 3 bus 74s came at once. 😑 And I ended up being late for work. If I had known there was this delay, I would definitely have taken a different bus to Clementi from the start. Really hope the app will be working again tomorrow. 🙏🏻",

But the psychology of suddenly having a large sum of money in your pocket, vs the year-on-year growth of equity in the stock market, that's remarkably different. Real estate is definitely more shiok.

After doing my sums, I would have been in more or less the same financial position if I had put the money in s&p, which was where I originally liquidated from to buy the house. But the psychology of suddenly having a large sum of money in your pocket, vs the year-on-year growth of equity in the stock market, that's remarkably different. Real estate is definitely more shiok. Anyway, I kept arguing that between the 2 it would have been a wash, but my best friend said, something that kinda clicked in my head: Even if property market goes down, you have a roof over your head.",
