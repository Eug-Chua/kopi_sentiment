The fear that Singapore's rapid population growth is outpacing its ability to support residents is particularly acute, with concerns about traffic congestion and overcrowding in areas like Dover and Beauty World. Job market insecurity dominates career-related fears, especially among fresh graduates questioning whether computer science degrees still guarantee the $7,000 starting salaries of the past. Personal safety concerns also surface around scam calls and workplace surveillance, creating a climate of wariness about both digital and physical security.",

Government policies and bureaucratic inefficiencies are drawing sharp criticism, from the personal mobility device restrictions to poor public transport connectivity between regions.
