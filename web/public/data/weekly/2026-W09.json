Singaporeans express deep concerns about the government's population policies, with many fearing that taking in 25,000-30,000 new citizens annually will fundamentally alter the nation's character and create unsustainable competition for jobs and resources. Housing affordability fears intensify as residents worry about being priced out of their own country. There's also growing unease about AI disruption, workplace exploitation, and whether younger generations can ever achieve the same standard of living as their parents.",

Housing costs trigger the most visceral reactions, with residents furious that properties are treated as investment vehicles rather than basic shelter, making homeownership increasingly impossible for young Singaporeans. Political frustrations run deep, with citizens expressing outrage over ministerial salaries, lack of transparency in public spending, and perceived government indifference to citizen concerns about immigration and infrastructure strain. Social issues like workplace discrimination, dating difficulties, and urban overcrowding compound the sense that the system is failing ordinary Singaporeans.",
