It reminds me to appreciate the simple things and the privilege I already have, rather than constantly chasing the next thing. For me, the real benefit isn't just the savings; it's the realisation that lasting happiness comes from improving your daily baseline—like having more control over your time or a less stressful environment—rather than chasing short-lived spikes in excitement. You stop 'denying' yourself once you realise that contentment is something you cultivate from within, not something you get from a purchase.
