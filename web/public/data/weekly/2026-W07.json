Singaporeans express deep concerns about lenient traffic laws and inadequate punishment for dangerous drivers. Financial insecurity runs as an undercurrent, with many worrying about retirement adequacy, job stability, and housing affordability despite having average CPF contributions. The combination of immediate safety threats and long-term financial vulnerability creates a climate of heightened anxiety about both present dangers and future security.",

The driver's alleged callous behavior after killing a child - including arguing with witnesses and showing no remorse - has triggered intense anger about Singapore's perceived soft approach to traffic violations. Anti-CECA sentiment surfaces repeatedly, with frustrations about foreign talent policies and workplace discrimination. Daily irritants like soaring Grab prices, work burnout culture, and housing costs add fuel to an already volatile mood, creating a perfect storm of public frustration.",

Since the renal artery and the arteries he severed are markedly different and recognisable, this mistake should have been easily discovered during the surgery unless the doctor is grossly incompetent. The fact that he paused for 13 minutes and decided not to consult other doctors and try to rectify the error when the victim was already on the table shows he is more willing to cover his ass than do what is best for the patient. A lot of excuses after the surgery. If he believed his actions were the best, which is to close the victim up and observe, I'm sure the surgical notes would have been transparent and instructions would have been given for the victim to be closely monitored and clear next steps given, not wait for the woman to be crying in pain then take 45 minutes to provide instructions, then go through all the different tests. He is trying to cover his mistakes over and over again, which caused death.",
