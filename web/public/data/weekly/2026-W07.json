A lot of excuses after the surgery. If he believed his actions were the best, which is to close the victim up and observe, I'm sure the surgical notes would have been transparent and instructions would have been given for the victim to be closely monitored and clear next steps given, not wait for the woman to be crying in pain then take 45 minutes to provide instructions, then go through all the different tests.
