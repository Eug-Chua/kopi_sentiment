Many Singaporeans express deep concern about reckless driving, particularly by older drivers and private hire drivers who multitask behind the wheel. Financial insecurities run high as well, with residents worried about job cuts, debt consolidation, and whether their CPF savings will be sufficient for retirement. The pervasive sense of vulnerability extends beyond personal safety to broader concerns about Singapore's changing social fabric and economic pressures.",

      "summary": "Rage over Singapore's lenient traffic laws reaches a boiling point after the fatal Chinatown accident involving a 6-year-old victim. The driver's alleged callous response - arguing with bystanders and showing no remorse - has sparked intense public anger about justice and accountability. Housing costs, workplace burnout culture, and everyday irritations like surge pricing and air quality compound the collective frustration. There's particular resentment about what many see as a two-tiered justice system and insufficient government action on core quality-of-life issues.",

She turned to me and replied she didnt see and there is no need to raise my voice. I replied louder in front of all the people in the place, \"U didnt see me, WTF!\" In English. She went quietly to the end of the queue. After I got my order, i deliberately walked to her. Before I can opened my mouth she shouted at me saying, \"U are of a low quality character to scold me like that\". I replied in Mandarin, \"I have to do so with people of low quality like u\".

A lot of excuses after the surgery. If he believed his actions were the best, which is to close the victim up and observe, I'm sure the surgical notes would have been transparent and instructions would have been given for the victim to be closely monitored and clear next steps given, not wait for the woman to be crying in pain then take 45 minutes to provide instructions, then go through all the different tests.

Shortly after, a seat opens up beside his wife (diagonally opposite him) without caring- he stands up, pushed past me (beside me was the pole..) and steps on my foot (I was wearing slippers some more) at the same time and made me stumble, so that he could get the sit beside his wife. My husband had to catch me as I was falling, and this guy didn't even say sorry or anything- and my husband said \"eh uncle\" as he saw how hard he pushed past me. I immediately thank my husband for standing up for me. And right after I looked back at the uncle and told him that he pushed and stepped on me in mandarin.

Just few days ago at Ya Kun Kaya Toast (Fortune Center) I was second in a queue of at least 8 pax, waiting for my turn. I was one arm's length from the person in front. Then a PRC woman stood just outside but between me and the person in front. She took out her phone and took a pic of the menu which was between me and the first in queue. I had a feeling (likely stereotyped her) she was going to cut queue so i inched in closer to the person in front. She saw that and without facing me, she slid in between me and the person in front. I kept quiet and waited to see if she would really make her order when it was her turn. And just as she thought i let that slid, she opened her mouth to make her order to the cashier oblivious to the whole move, i raised my voice right at her face. \"Eh, there is a queue here, dont cut queue\" in Mandarin. She turned to me and replied she didnt see and there is no need to raise my voice. I replied louder in front of all the people in the place, \"U didnt see me, WTF!\" In English. She went quietly to the end of the queue. After I got my order, i deliberately walked to her. Before I can opened my mouth she shouted at me saying, \"U are of a low quality character to scold me like that\". I replied in Mandarin, \"I have to do so with people of low quality like u\". And i walked away. For that 20 secs or so while i walked away, she shouted at me scolding me. Her voice literally pierced through the whole ground floor of the building. I sashayed my ass slowly and quietly soaking in all the attention while making my exit. Stood up yes, let her screamed at me like a crazy uncivilised bitch. That was the icing for me.",
