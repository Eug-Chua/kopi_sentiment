# Kopi Sentiment
**Understanding the heartbeat of Singapore, one thread at a time.**

## Why This Matters

Singapore's fortunes are tied to global forces beyond its control. As PM Lawrence Wong noted: *"the rules-based international order is being tested and multilateral cooperation is fraying."* Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen echoed this: *"We are living in turbulent times... the global order changes before our very eyes."*

As a small nation navigating a shifting world order, what was normal is no longer normal. The rules Singapore rode to transform from third world to first are being rewritten.

This affects Singaporeans' daily lives in profound ways. **Kopi Sentiment** listens to what people are actually saying—and what they truly mean.


## What It Does

This tool mines Singapore subreddit discussions where people speak candidly about what's going on in Singapore, using the **FFGA Framework** to surface authentic voices:

- **Fears** - What worries or concerns do they have?
- **Frustrations** - What obstacles or annoyances do they face?
- **Goals** - What are they trying to achieve?
- **Aspirations** - What is their ideal future state?

The FFGA framework captures both **emotional** (fears, aspirations) and **practical** (frustrations, goals) dimensions of how Singaporeans experience this moment in history.

**Output**: A simple traffic light sentiment score (Green / Amber / Red) for each FFGA dimension, backed by actual quotes from real conversations.

## The Goal

To hear what is being said, and understand what is truly meant.

Not to prescribe solutions, but to listen deeply to the Singaporean psyche in an age of economic uncertainty and geopolitical tension.
