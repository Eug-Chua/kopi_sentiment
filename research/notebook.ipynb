Remember to wishlist it onsteamand join the discord to be in the early tests this year!https://discord.gg/thelastgeneral\", 'I really like some of the features in Total Annihilation, where you could program routes / waypoints and actions for units, such as \"Patrol\" etc. Very useful also for support-units, and it was as easy as chosing and action and holding down shift, and then click the route / area you wanted....', \"nothing is stopping you from staying in the golden age like the rest of RTS lovers :D coh3 is great, commandos is still there, great as ever (think there's a new game in the series which got good reviews?). In the c&c franchise I prefer generals/RA/RA2. But I agree with the sentiment that newer rts games should be more innovative but still stick to the old and proven.\", \"My comment was not against the innovation, but actually appreciative of this new title, which is reminiscent of the golden age - but modernised. In fact, WIC is what this reminded me of the most (though probably that's just the modern warfare setting). The classics sure have a decent replay value.Commandosshines here in my view, where there are often multiple ways to complete the missions - like solving puzzles. In C&C, the Tiberiumverse is my favourite C&C. Campy is good, and nothing against Red Alert (Volkov, Chrono-shifts, mind-controlled squid, other psychic stuff/psionics, and ofc 'I'm escaping to theoneplace that hasn't been corrupted by Capitalism!SPACE!!!') - I love other camp too (No One Lives Forever, and outside gaming, 007) - but my wargaming tastes lean more towards serious, dark, and gritty treatments. No surprise Tiberian Sun is one of my favourites, and Tiberium Wars after the Scrin show up.\", \"Someone has to come up with a control scheme that works on consoles. PC gaming is such a smaller market that high quality AAA RTS just isn't a thing unless it's StarCraft and SC2 was already bloody yonkies ago. They're hard to make balanced and fun, which doesn't help them for staying power, which is why MOBA sort of superceeded them all.\", 'Does steam have a reminder for games basically u get a notification if a game is released?

I don't get it - for an RTS you never have time to zoom in on the characters and see what they are doing so it makes no sense to do that in the promo video. I am a a bit confused if I control the squads or a single soldier at times.\", \"RTS games are something that for me have either been like baby's first RTS or You are the General you are not going to win if you havent watched like 5 hours of tutorials. I havent played this game, but this, this seems like something that anyone could get into. The highlighting feature seems very fun to use and building being more interactive than clicking on a button and waiting 5 minutes. I have somethings that dont seem to fit in for me, I am not saying they are bad I think they are cool, but as I said dont fit in, the sending troops to enter buildings is cool and being able to control them seems underlooked in other games.\", \"People do play games like this... Looks like every Eugen System game (Warno, Steel Division). Not sure how the highlighting of the ground works, but maybe that's novel, and if it works by making less micromanagement on top of a game similar to Warno then that'd be interesting for sure.\", \"Hi, long time fan of RTS here. I think it fits the bill. I played a ton of RTS since early C&C and Warcraft days. I played large scale rts from Total War series to Wargame. For me the thing that draws me in to modern military RTS is the explosions lol. Just building an army of hotwitzer and sending rain of fire is satisfying to watch. This is what I love about games like for example World In Conflict. Can't wait to try your demo.\", 'I’m not sure if the time for RTS games has already passed. Nowadays, fast-paced gameplay or games that don’t require quick results seem to be more popular. Still, I’d love to play some Close Combat in this kind of view ;)', 'Would love to see bodies and destroyed vehicles just being there and not despawning. Might be huge hit for performance if done wrong but i believe.', \"This is a weird one - but I will if you can't zoom out too much.
